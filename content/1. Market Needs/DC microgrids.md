## Description of need
The need for DC microgrids arises from the increasing integration of renewable energy sources, such as solar panels and wind turbines, which inherently produce direct current (DC) power, and the fact that many electrical loads (e.g. computers, [[Electric vehicles]], batteries) consume DC power.

DC microgrids offer greater efficiency in transmitting and storing this DC power, reducing the need for conversion to alternating current (AC) and minimizing energy losses. Additionally, DC microgrids enable the integration of energy storage systems and electric vehicles seamlessly.

To truly unlock DC microgrids, several key challenges must be overcome:
- Cost
- Standardization, interoperability, and regulatory frameworks
	- The nominal voltage is not standardized at the moment
- Stability and controllability in the face of voltage oscillations, faults, and arcing
	- Voltage regulation is challenging
	- Controlling power flow is challenging
	- Voltage oscillations can be caused "by DC converters with negative damping performance, the interaction between the DC microgrid and the DC converters, and the DC voltage control loop with positive feedback"
	- Fault management: No zero-point crossing means that arcs don't extinguish on their own

## Other learnings
DC microgrids:
- Reduce losses in the distribution system, helps reduce the need for transformers and inverters
- Equipment is still expensive and not widely available today
- Lacks common standards
- Not well known to installers yet
- DC microgrids could be the future for many sites, but cost, standardization, and power stability are major challenges
- Inverters are a weakest link in AC microgrids, which is an advantage for DC microgrids
