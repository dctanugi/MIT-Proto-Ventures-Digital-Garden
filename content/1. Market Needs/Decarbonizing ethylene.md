## Description of need
The need is to decarbonize the production of ethylene, a crucial chemical compound used in various industries, including plastics, chemicals, and automotive. Ethylene production is currently heavily reliant on fossil fuels, primarily natural gas, resulting in significant carbon emissions. Reducing these emissions is essential to combat climate change and meet sustainability goals.

## Problem severity (1-10)
The problem severity is approximately 9 on the scale. Ethylene production is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the chemical industry. Decarbonizing this process is critical for reducing the industry's environmental impact and achieving global emissions reduction targets.

## Who has this need
Various stakeholders have this need:
1. **Chemical Manufacturers:** Companies involved in ethylene production are actively seeking solutions to decarbonize their processes to align with sustainability goals and regulatory requirements.
2. **Environmental Organizations:** Environmental groups advocate for reducing emissions in industrial processes, including ethylene production, to mitigate climate change.
3. **Governments:** Governments worldwide are implementing regulations and incentives to encourage the reduction of carbon emissions in industrial sectors, making ethylene production decarbonization a priority.

## Total addressable market (TAM)
The total addressable market for decarbonizing ethylene production is significant. It includes all the ethylene production facilities globally, which are spread across various industries. Ethylene is a fundamental chemical, and its production accounts for a substantial portion of global industrial emissions.

## Solutions today, and their shortcomings
### Current solutions:
1. **Steam Cracking:** The most common method for ethylene production involves steam cracking of hydrocarbons, such as natural gas. This process is highly energy-intensive and relies on fossil fuels, resulting in substantial carbon emissions.
2. **Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS):** Some facilities have implemented CCS technology to capture and store carbon emissions. However, CCS is expensive, energy-intensive, and does not eliminate emissions but only reduces them.
### Shortcomings:
1. **Limited Emission Reduction:** Existing methods like CCS only partially address the emissions problem, and they do not provide a comprehensive solution for decarbonization.
2. **High Cost:** CCS and other incremental improvements can be prohibitively expensive for many ethylene production facilities, especially for smaller operations.
3. **Energy Intensity:** The current processes are highly energy-intensive, contributing to increased operational costs and making the industry vulnerable to fluctuations in energy prices.
