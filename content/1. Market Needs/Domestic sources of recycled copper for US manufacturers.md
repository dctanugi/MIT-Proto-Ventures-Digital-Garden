## Description of need

Copper is a critical material for numerous industries, including electronics, electric vehicles, renewable energy infrastructure, and telecommunications. As the demand for copper continues to rise, driven by the clean energy transition and rapid technological advancements, US manufacturers face increasing pressure to secure reliable, cost-effective, and sustainable sources of copper. However, current domestic copper production, both from mining and recycling, falls short of meeting demand, creating a growing reliance on imports, which exposes manufacturers to supply chain risks, price volatility, and geopolitical instability. Developing domestic sources of recycled copper is essential for enhancing supply chain resilience, supporting sustainable practices, and reducing the environmental footprint associated with traditional mining.

## Problem severity (1-10)

8

## Who has this need

- US manufacturers in the electronics, automotive, and renewable energy sectors
- Electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers
- Green energy companies (solar, wind, energy storage)
- Cable and telecommunications companies
- Defense contractors relying on domestic sourcing for critical materials
- Government agencies focusing on supply chain security and sustainability

## Total addressable market (TAM)

The TAM for recycled copper in the US is estimated to be over $10 billion annually, driven by demand across sectors such as electric vehicles, renewable energy, electronics, and infrastructure. With copper consumption expected to grow substantially due to the clean energy transition and electrification, the TAM could increase significantly in the coming years.

## Solutions today, and their shortcomings

Current solutions for copper supply include:

- **Primary copper mining**: Traditional mining is environmentally destructive, energy-intensive, and often reliant on international sources, leading to supply chain risks.
- **Copper recycling from scrap**: While copper recycling is a mature technology, current recycling methods often result in lower purity, and inefficiencies in collection and processing hinder scalability. Additionally, the recycling infrastructure in the US is underdeveloped compared to other regions, such as Europe and China.
- **Import reliance**: The US imports a significant portion of its copper needs, which increases vulnerability to supply chain disruptions and price fluctuations.

These solutions fail to adequately address the demand for high-purity, environmentally friendly, and domestically sourced recycled copper.

## Potentially relevant capabilities

- **Advanced e-waste processing**: Technologies focused on recovering copper from electronic waste (PCBs, cables, etc.) could provide a valuable domestic source of recycled copper.
- **Urban mining technologies**: Innovations in the extraction of metals from existing urban resources (buildings, infrastructure) can help boost copper recovery.
- **High-efficiency recycling technologies**: Processes like hydrometallurgical and electrochemical methods to recover high-purity copper from scrap materials can enhance copper recycling.
- **Supply chain and logistics innovations**: Improved collection and sorting methods, as well as advanced AI or robotic systems for e-waste and scrap management, can scale domestic copper recycling efforts.
