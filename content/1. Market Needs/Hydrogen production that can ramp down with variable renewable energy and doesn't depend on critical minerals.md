## Description of need
With the increasing adoption of variable renewable energy (VRE) sources like wind and solar, there is a pressing need for hydrogen production technologies that can dynamically adjust to fluctuating power availability. Current electrolyzers struggle to handle intermittent energy efficiently and often rely on critical minerals, which limits their scalability and resilience to supply chain disruptions. A hydrogen production solution that can flexibly ramp down, ramp up, and avoid critical minerals would enable more effective integration with VRE and support decarbonization goals.

## Problem severity (1-10)
8

## Who has this need
- Renewable energy developers and operators seeking to balance supply and demand
- Utility companies and energy storage providers
- Industrial users of hydrogen (e.g., steel, chemicals, and refining)
- Green hydrogen producers and suppliers
- Policymakers and governments aiming to accelerate hydrogen adoption in their decarbonization strategies

## Total addressable market (TAM)
The green hydrogen market is projected to grow significantly, with estimates suggesting it could reach over $100 billion annually by 2030 and far higher by mid-century. As the market for renewable energy expands, the demand for adaptable, critical mineral-free hydrogen production solutions is expected to increase as well, capturing a substantial share of the hydrogen production industry.

## Solutions today, and their shortcomings
1. **Proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers**: While capable of adjusting power, they require critical minerals like platinum and iridium, making them costly and dependent on limited resources.
2. **Alkaline electrolyzers**: Generally less responsive to variable power, and while they avoid some critical minerals, they struggle to operate efficiently with intermittent energy sources.
3. **Solid oxide electrolyzers**: High efficiency but suited for constant, high-temperature operations, making them incompatible with fluctuating renewable energy sources.
4. **Battery-backed systems**: Battery storage can help buffer VRE fluctuations, but this adds complexity, cost, and additional critical mineral requirements to the system.

## Potentially relevant capabilities
- [[Intermediate-temperature molten salt water electrolysis for hydrogen]] from [[Yogesh (Yogi) Surendranath]] et al.
- **Critical mineral-free catalysts**: Development of alternative catalyst materials that avoid rare and expensive minerals while maintaining high hydrogen production efficiency.
- **Advanced control systems**: Smart systems that can dynamically adjust electrolyzer operation to optimize performance with VRE, such as incorporating AI-driven predictive models to anticipate power availability.
- **Hybrid systems**: Combining electrolyzers with other forms of renewable energy storage (e.g., thermal or chemical) to better manage intermittent energy without relying on batteries or critical minerals.
