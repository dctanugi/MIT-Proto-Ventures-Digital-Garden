up:: [[Scrap metal recycling]]

## Description of need
Metal scrap facilities need "better" solutions for processing and sorting of metal scrap prior to moving inbound material to a smelter or mill. This includes:
- Size reduction
- Size and shape separation
- Material liberation and contaminant removal
- Lifting
- Transporting
- Confirmed positive material identification

The extent to which to process scrap material (e.g. to turn a #2 copper into a #1 copper by shearing off a soldered joint, or ‘‘irony/dirty aluminum extrusions” into a clean or painted 6063 alloy by removing a weather-strip and a couple screws) depends on market conditions, which can change drastically within the same day.
