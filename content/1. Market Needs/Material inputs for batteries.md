## Description of need
The global battery market is already running up against material input constraints, particularly nickel, cobalt, etc for Li-ion batteries. See [[Elsa Olivetti]]'s research.

There is a growing need for a reliable, cost-stable, sustainable supply of material inputs for batteries.

## Problem severity (1-10)
8

## Who has this need
Battery manufacturers
Car manufacturers

## Total addressable market (TAM)
XXL

## Solutions today, and their shortcomings
- Regular sourcing approaches
- Battery recycling (e.g. [[Redwood Materials]])

## Potentially relevant capabilities
There is a startup at [[Activate]] that is developing organic active cathode materials with no critical materials.
