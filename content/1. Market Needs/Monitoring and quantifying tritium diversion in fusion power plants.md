## Description of need
Willms pointed out a need for monitoring and quantifying tritium "diversion" (e.g. accumulation of tritium on the first wall in a [[Nuclear fusion]] reactor).

This is primarily a nuclear proliferation risk: Disendorf et al. find that a mature fusion industry would facilitate construction of large, efficient, and reliable nuclear arsenals by producing tritium and the fissile materials Plutonium-239 and Uranium-233.

In particular, tritium is used to boost the explosive power of a fission explosion.
