## Description of need
The main challenges with hydrogen storage today revolve around its properties as a gas. Hydrogen is a highly reactive and low-density gas, which makes it difficult to store and transport efficiently. This is a major challenge in the growth of the [[Clean hydrogen]] economy.

According to ChatGPT, hydrogen storage technologies, especially those that provide high-density storage, can be expensive to develop and manufacture. The cost of materials, fabrication processes, and infrastructure needed for storage can hinder the widespread adoption of hydrogen as an energy carrier.

Liquid hydrogen is one approach to storage. According to [[Carl Bunge]], improvement areas for liquid hydrogen storage efficiency include active-passive cooling, ortho-para conversion, and thermo-physical properties.

But a major issue with liquid hydrogen storage is boil-off. It occurs because hydrogen has a very low boiling point. Researchers such as [[John Brisson]] are working on techniques to re-liquefy the boiled-off hydrogen.
