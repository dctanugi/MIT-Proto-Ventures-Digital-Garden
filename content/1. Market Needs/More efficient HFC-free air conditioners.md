## Description of need
The Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol curbs the use of HFCs as refrigerants.

## Problem severity (1-10)
8

## Who has this need
Air conditioning companies that need to come up with an HFC-free solution

## Total addressable market (TAM)
Billions

## Solutions today, and their shortcomings
- Manufactured hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs) are among the most popular alternative refrigerants available. According to The Protocol and [EIA](https://eia-international.org/news/new-family-of-synthetic-refrigerant-gases-poses-potential-dangers-to-human-health-and-the-environment), they come with concerns about their environmental impact because they break down into another chemical that is increasingly building up in water systems.
- Propane
- Companies like Danfoss [offer cooling systems](https://www.danfoss.com/en-us/about-danfoss/our-businesses/cooling/refrigerants-and-energy-efficiency/refrigerants-for-lowering-the-gwp/carbon-dioxide-co2/) with CO2 as the refrigerant
