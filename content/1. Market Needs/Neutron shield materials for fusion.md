## Description of need
Developing shield materials to protect [[High-temperature superconducting magnets]] from irradiation. 

The main metrics of interest are:
1. Shield lifetime (target: 30 years instead of 1 month)
2. Nuclear heating (target < 0.1 kW instead of 50 kW)
3. Damage energy (target: 20 W instead of 1000 W)

## Problem severity (1-10)
4
## Who has this need
Fusion companies
## Total addressable market (TAM)

## Solutions today, and their shortcomings
- Hydrides tend to liberate hydrogen and ignite.

## Potentially relevant capabilities
- Lance Snead (Stony Brook University) is collaborating with [[MIT Plasma Science & Fusion Center|PSFC]] ([[Ethan Peterson]]), and [[Tokamak Energy]] and [[Commonwealth Fusion Systems|CFS]]. They are trying to embed hydrides in a matrix that is permeable to hydrogen (like MgO or Ti). Up to 25% hydrogens.
