## Description of need
Looking at the entire span from conductors, splicers, etc. if I designed this asset for failure mode and ignitions as a fundamental design principle, could I create a next-generation grid asset that's much less likely to ignite a wildfire?

For example, What if you could create a conductor where inside the casing, there was spring tension, such that if it broke, the spring tension would force the pieces of conductor to retract?
