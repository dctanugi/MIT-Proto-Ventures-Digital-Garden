Potential approaches:
- Solid-state heating (to replace [[Ion cyclotron range of frequencies (ICRF) heating|ICRF]] tetrodes). Requires higher breakdown voltage: 600 V / 1.1 kA according to [[Theodore (Theo) Mouratidis]]
- [[Gyrotron]]s that are high efficiency, durable over thousands of hours, and deliver megawatts of power, and [[RF antennas that can withstand fusion conditions]].
