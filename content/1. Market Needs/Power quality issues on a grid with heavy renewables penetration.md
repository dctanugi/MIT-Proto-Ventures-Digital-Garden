## Description of need
As the world transitions towards a more sustainable energy future, the integration of renewable energy sources like solar and wind into the electric grid has significantly increased. However, this shift poses challenges to maintaining stable power quality, which is crucial for the reliable and efficient operation of the grid.

## Problem severity (1-10)
7

## Who has this need
Electric utility companies, grid operators, renewable energy project developers, regulatory authorities.

## Total addressable market (TAM)
Billions

## Solutions today, and their shortcomings
According to ChatGPT (not fully fact checked, but looks reasonable):
1. **Grid Upgrades**: One approach is to reinforce the existing grid infrastructure to accommodate the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources. This may involve upgrading transmission and distribution lines to handle increased power flows and voltage fluctuations. However, grid upgrades can be expensive and time-consuming, especially in regions with outdated infrastructure.
2. **Energy Storage Systems**: Battery storage and other energy storage technologies can store excess renewable energy during periods of high generation and release it during times of low generation, helping to smooth out power fluctuations. But energy storage systems, while effective at mitigating short-term fluctuations, may have limited capacity to address prolonged periods of low renewable generation.
3. **Advanced Forecasting and Control**: Improved weather forecasting and real-time monitoring allow grid operators to anticipate changes in renewable energy output and adjust grid operations accordingly. However, weather forecasting is not always precise, leading to potential mismatches between predicted and actual renewable energy generation.
