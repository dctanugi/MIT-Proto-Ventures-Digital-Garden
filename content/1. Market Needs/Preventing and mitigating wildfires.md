up:: [[Forest fires]]
## Description of need
Many wildfires are caused by power line failures. Some power lines are especially far from fire stations. 

## Problem severity (1-10)
8

## Who has this need
Utility companies
State governments

## Total addressable market (TAM)


## Solutions today, and their shortcomings
Satellite-related solutions:
- [OroraTech](https://ororatech.com/) Â is plotting a small satellite constellation dedicated to wildfire monitoring.
- Hitachi Energy [announced](https://spacenews.com/connecting-the-dots-wildfires-are-advancing-but-so-is-satellite-technology/) a solution in May to help utilities prevent wildfires using artificial technology and imagery satellites from Maxar Technologies.
- [Chooch AI](https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/why-tech-has-been-slow-to-fight-wildfires-extreme-weather/2219241/) uses a system that analyzes satellite images every 10 minutes to identify where new wildfires started
- Salo Sciences teamed up with Planet, a satellite company founded by NASA scientists, to build a monitoring system called theÂ [California Forest Observatory](https://forestobservatory.com/), which uses AI and satellite images to create a detailed map of forested land in California to help predict and prevent wildfires.


## Potentially relevant capabilities
[[Satellite-based remote sensing for wildfire prevention]]

Satellites for fire monitoring include:
- Spectroradiometer (e.g. MODIS on Terra / Aqua)
- Radiometer (e.g. VIIRS on SUOPI NPP)
- Infrared sensor (e.g. Landsat 8)
- Synthetic aperture radar (e.g. on Sentinel)
