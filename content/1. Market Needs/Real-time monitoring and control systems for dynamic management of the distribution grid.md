## Description of need
There is an opportunity to make the *distribution* grid more intelligent and active. Right now there is no real-time monitoring, unlike the transmission grid. The distribution utility doesn't know how close a transformer is to overload. So they overbuild as a result

Note: there is no *DR at the distribution level today*!  Maybe you could get paid by the distribution utility to increase how much energy they sell, but helping them interconnect more projects without needing new upgrades. Might require managed demand or curtailment.

## Problem severity (1-10)
7

## Who has this need
Distribution utilities would like to sell more electricity. 

## Total addressable market (TAM)


## Solutions today, and their shortcomings


## Potentially relevant capabilities
- Distribution *monitoring* systems
- Distribution *control* systems
- Managed demand.
