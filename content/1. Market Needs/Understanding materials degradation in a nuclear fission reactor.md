## Description of need
[[Nuclear fission]] reactors involve lots of radiation, primarily of alpha particles (helium nucleus), beta particles (electrons), and gamma rays. 

There is a need to better understand and predict the degradation created by alpha particles, and to design materials that can better withstand this irradiation, in order to build more resilient and cost-effective nuclear plants.
