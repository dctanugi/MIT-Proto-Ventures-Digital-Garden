## Description of capability
A key problem in [[Clean hydrogen]] electrolysis is the formation of _bubbles_. These bubbles passivate the electrodes. You then need a membrane to prevent gas mixing. They also lead to ohmic losses and other problems. No matter what surface texture you have, you still get these 'sticky' bubbles that are hard to remove.

Varanasi is developing surfaces that _attract_ bubbles. This is contrast with most surfaces, which are typically gasphobic. This removes the bubbles from the electrodes. 

Ultimately this enables electrolyzers that are membrane-less. It could also be used for other gas-evolving systems, e.g. hydrogen + oxygen evolution.

Note: How about making better barriers for hydrogen?
- Zirconia as a well-known H blocker. Typically people think about zirconia inside steel, but Kripa proposes a zirconia-lubricant composite.
