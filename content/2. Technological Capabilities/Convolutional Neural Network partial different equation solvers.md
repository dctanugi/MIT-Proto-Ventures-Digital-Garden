## Description of capability
There is a prof in Math department who is pioneering applications of CNNs to partial differential equations, but nobody is really applying this to fusion. Amelia reckons this would make plasma simulation codes more efficient. 
## Key people
[[Amelia Cavallaro]]
## Technology Readiness Level (1-9)
2
## Needs that this could potentially address
[[Better plasma simulation software for fusion companies]]
## Tech specs

## Estimated time & cost to commercialize

## Outstanding risks
