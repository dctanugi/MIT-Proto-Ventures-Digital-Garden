## Description of capability
According to Vestergaard et al., distributed ledger technology (DLT) is a set of technologies that enable a consistent representation of data across multiple nodes without a central authority. DLT enables a distributed record or “ledger” in which transactions are stored in a permanent, immutable way with cryptographic techniques, ensuring consistency, provenance, and auditability across the entire ecosystem. Transactions can be easily audited as they are time-stamped and “hashed,” essentially a digital fingerprint that interlinks transactions as they are appended to the ledger.
