## Description of capability
This capability is a joint development for [[Geothermal energy]] between [[Jack Hare]]'s group at [[MIT Plasma Science & Fusion Center|PSFC]] and [[Eden Geopower]]. According to their [[ARPA-e]] funding webpage:
>Eden will develop a new class of hydraulic fracturing methods to create fluid pathways for water to be heated and extracted for power production. Eden’s new “Electro-Hydraulic Fracturing” (E-HF) technology will use electricity and water to access a more extensive fracture network for heat recovery.

## Key people
[[Antonio Magnanimo]], [[Jack Hare]]

## Technology Readiness Level (1-9)
3

## Needs that this could potentially address
Cost-effective deep geothermal

## Tech specs
According to the ARPA-e proposal,
>This E-HF process will increase the heat transfer surface area for the water circulating through fractures, improving EGS power plant efficiency up to 500%. This technology can potentially save 270 billion gallons of water by limiting water use compared with traditional hydraulic fracturing and would provide access to untapped renewable geothermal energy.

## Estimated time & cost to commercialize
5 years
$50M

## Outstanding risks
- Commercial: [[Eden Geopower]] will presumably have a right of first refusal on any IP that comes out of the research at [[MIT Plasma Science & Fusion Center|PSFC]]
