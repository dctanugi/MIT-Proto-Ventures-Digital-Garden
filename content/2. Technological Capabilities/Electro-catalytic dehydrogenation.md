## Description of capability
- [[Rui Zeng]] in the [[Yogesh (Yogi) Surendranath]] Group is working on catalytic conversions that use a palladium membrane (and typically a rubidium/cesium catalyst.)
- Hydrogen dissociates at the palladium membrane surface, diffuses through the palladium in atomic form, and forms H2 or H2O on the other surface.
- The membrane can have a voltage bias, and be exposed to a molten salt electrolyte on the other side, and there can be a counter-electrode in that molten salt, which allows you to essentially drive the hydrogen away from the palladium membrane.
- The hydrogen forms H2O upon exiting the palladium membrane, and evolves from H2O to H2 further away upon contacting the counter-electrode.
- This can be used for several applications:
	- Ammonia cracking ($NH_3 \rightarrow H_2 + N_2$)
	- Methane catalysis: $CH_4 + H_2O \rightarrow CO_2 + H_2$
	- Ethane de-hydrogenation ([[Chemical process to make ethylene and hydrogen from ethane]])
- Yogi recommends focusing on ammonia cracking first.
