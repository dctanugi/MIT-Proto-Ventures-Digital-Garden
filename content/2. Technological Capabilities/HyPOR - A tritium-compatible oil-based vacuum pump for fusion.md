## Description of capability
[[George Larsen]] et al. at [[Savannah River National Laboratory]] propose to use tritium-resistant oils and then detritiate and purify the tritiated oil. This would be combined with commercially-available hydrogen separation membranes to reduce tritium inventory.

## Key people
[[George Larsen]]

## Technology Readiness Level (1-9)
2

## Needs that this could potentially address
[[Durable tritium-compatible vacuum pumps]]

## Tech specs
According to the inventors, compared to State of the Art: 
- 4× reduction in tritium inventory 
- 10× reduction in auxiliary electrical consumption
- 50× reduction in pump system costs
- 140× reduction pump operational costs

## Estimated time & cost to commercialize
Unknown

## Outstanding risks
Unknown
