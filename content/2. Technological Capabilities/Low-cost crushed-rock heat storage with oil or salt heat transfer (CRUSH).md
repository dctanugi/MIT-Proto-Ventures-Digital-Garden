## Description of capability
[[Charles Forsberg]] proposes a low-cost crushed-rock facility for heat storage with oil or salt heat transfer. This would typically be paired with a [[Concentrated solar power]] or [[Nuclear fission]] plant to produce power. 

## Key people
[[Charles Forsberg]]

## Technology Readiness Level (1-9)
3

## Needs that this could potentially address
[[Long-duration energy storage]]
[[Duck curve]]

## Tech specs
- A facility would cost $100M and store 100 GWh on a seasonal timescale, producing power at 30-40% efficiency.
- Temperature: 400-600 ºC.

## Estimated time & cost to commercialize
- $100M of R&D before a pilot
- Pilot would cost $100M

## Outstanding risks
- No IP (yet). Maybe some potential IP around the strategy for spraying fluid on the right sections.
