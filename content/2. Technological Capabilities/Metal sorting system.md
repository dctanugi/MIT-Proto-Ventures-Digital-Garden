## Description of capability
[[Matthew Pierre-Louis]] and teammates at MIT are developing a metal sorting system that takes small granules of mixed metals and separates them based on x-rays, infrared, and optical measurements.

## Key people
[[Matthew Pierre-Louis]]

## Technology Readiness Level (1-9)
2

## Needs that this could potentially address
Metal needs for the energy transition
[[Recovering copper from automotive scrap]]

## Tech specs
Initial attempt with off-the-shelf technology separated Al from Cu with 99% accuracy.

## Estimated time & cost to commercialize
3 years

## Outstanding risks
 - Uniqueness
 - Material uniformity of granules
