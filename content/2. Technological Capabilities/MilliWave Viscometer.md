## Description of capability
This instrument can aid efforts to store radioactive wastes in stable glass. It could also have applications in other industries involved in processing molten materials.

It works by measuring a key parameter for processing molten materials: viscosity. This technology is special because it works at the temperatures of molten glass and metals. [[Paul Woskov]] was quoted as saying it would be much more robust and reliable in a manufacturing environment, and also less costly than alternative instruments.
