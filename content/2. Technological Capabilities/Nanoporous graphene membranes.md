## Description of capability
Membranes from nanoporous graphene

## Key people
[[Rohit Karnik]]

## Technology Readiness Level (1-9)
- Comparable maturity to [[Palladium plug membranes for hydrogen separation]].


## Needs that this could potentially address
- Nanoparticle removal from solvents in semiconductor fabs. Chemical compatibility. Fabrication is not trivial, because of the support. Polymeric supports may not be chemically compatible with the process. Ceramic supports get very pricey. For high value products, the cost of graphene is irrelevant.
- Hydrogen storage via decalin dehydrogenation

## Intellectual property status
- MIT has quite a bit of IP in this space.

## Tech specs
- Rohit's group has has been doing hydrogen/hydrocarbon separations at 500 K consecutively for a month. Get selectivities around 70-90 of hydrogen relative to decalin for dehydrogenation.

## Estimated time & cost to commercialize
3-5 years to product, according to Rohit.

## Outstanding risks
- Potential competition:
	- EPFL has a nanoporous graphene startup for carbon capture. ([[Michael Strano]]'s postdoc)
	- Rohit's postdoc who is now at Peking University is trying to do something.
