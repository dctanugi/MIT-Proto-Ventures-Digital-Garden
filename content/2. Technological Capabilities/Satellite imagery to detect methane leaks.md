## Description of capability
[[Kerri Cahoy]] proposes an integrated framework to synthesize all the relevant data sets and instruments to monitor methane emissions, especially from orphaned oil wells. [[Environmental Defense Fund]] has a database of these orphaned oil wells.

- [[Synthetic aperture radar]] can differentiate between oil and water. That can help you detect oil leaks.
- [[LIDAR]] can also help.

[[Google X]] is funding more work on this topic.

## Key people
[[Kerri Cahoy]] and her graduate students, esp. Kristen Ammons

## Technology Readiness Level (1-9)
3

## Needs that this could potentially address
[[Reducing methane flaring, venting, and leaking to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and increase natural gas supply]]

## Tech specs
TBD

## Estimated time & cost to commercialize
2 years

## Outstanding risks
