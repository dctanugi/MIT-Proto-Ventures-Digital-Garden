## Description of capability
[[Joseph V Minervini]], [[John Brisson]], et al. are proposing the development of superconducting, cryogenically cooled DC power distribution cables, especially for behind-the-meter applications like microgrids and data centers:
- Superconducting cable is made of twisted stacks of [[REBCO superconducting material]] (relies on IP from [[Makoto Takayasu]])
- This cable goes into a flexible cryostat (note: existing ones are expensive per meter today, so we would need to build something new.)
- The transition to from cryogenic temperatures to room temperature requires a specialized component.
