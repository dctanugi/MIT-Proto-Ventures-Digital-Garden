## Description of capability
[[High-temperature superconducting magnets|HTS magnets]] in [[gyrotrons]] and advanced waveguides could enable new materials processing applications for a decarbonized economy, e.g. mining ore sorting, Li-ion battery recycling. A company commercializing this technology could ultimately serve the fusion industry.
