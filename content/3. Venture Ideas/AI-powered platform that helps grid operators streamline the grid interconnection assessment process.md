## Description of venture idea
[[Francis O'Sullivan]] had suggested providing the entities charged with the interconnection queue with tools to streamline their feasibility assessments. The assessment process is very complex, in part because it is dynamic: some proposed projects in the queue might come online, which would change everything for other projects in the queue. 

## Market needs this venture would address
[[Shortening the transmission grid interconnection queue for new electricity projects]]

## Technical capabilities this venture might leverage
[[Artificial intelligence and machine learning|AI/ML]]

## Business model
TBD. SaaS?

## Team
None

## Outstanding risks
- However, Frank cautioned that this is a problem that is very difficult to get into because you can probably can't easily get paid.
