## Description of venture idea
There is an emerging need for materials that can withstand irradiation in nuclear environments. A design & development platform that accelerates the discovery & testing process would unlock new applications for aerospace, nuclear fission, and fusion.

## Market needs this venture would address
Rapid development and testing of materials for nuclear environments for the fission, fusion, and space industries

## Technical capabilities this venture might leverage
- [[Rapid Automated Materials - Design, Downselect, Deploy (RAM-3D)]]
- [[Proton radiation testing as a service]]

## Business model
TBD

## Team
[[Myles Stapelberg]]
[[Mike Short]]

## Outstanding risks
- Participants at the [[2023-11-30 Proto Ventures Channel Forum]] were concerned that this endeavor needs commercial governance and interface with regulation. This is hard to do as a venture.
