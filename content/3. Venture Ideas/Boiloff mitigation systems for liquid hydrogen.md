## Description of venture idea
As much as 1% of all stored liquid hydrogen boils off every day, complicating the viability of liquid H2 as a hydrogen transport method. This venture would deliver new systems that help liquid H2 storage & transport companies prevent or mitigate boiloff.

## Market needs this venture would address
- Preventing boil-off of liquid hydrogen

## Technical capabilities this venture might leverage
- [[ [[Thermo-acoustic expander]]]]
- [[Collins cryocooler]]
- [[Vuilleumier cycle cryocooler]]

## Business model
TBD

## Team
[[John Brisson]]
[[Carl Bunge]]
[[Jacob Adams]]

## Outstanding risks
- Liquid hydrogen may not be a major pathway for transporting hydrogen
- Liquid hydrogen may or may not be a major way to store hydrogen
