## Description of capability
[[Mike Short]] has developed a coating that prevents fouling by metal oxides, aka "crud", on hot surfaces in heat transfer applications. 
- Mike's group developed a coating with the same optical properties as the surrounding fluid, which eliminates the van der waals forces. You can coat metals or ceramics with it.
- The research sponsors waived their right to an exclusive license. [[EPRI]] and [[Exelon]] were the sponsors and have taken a license, but not exclusive. [[Equinor]] funded it but didn't license it.
- Mike is also working on a $600K, two-year sponsored research project with [[Deep Power]]  and [[Wings Fund]] in collaboration with the University of Iceland to apply this technology to geothermal. Deep Power will have a non-exclusive license for the area of geothermal energy.
-  $600K total funded by Wings Fund, in collaboration with University of Iceland, for two years, regular sponsored research. No new science needed. This is a "cook and look" project now. It's all about identifying new coatings that can last at low pH. Wings is funding work at Oklahoma and UCLA. The startup is called [[Deep Power]].
- Since the Langmuir publication, three materials identified that work even better, including tetrahedral amorphous carbon.
- They have verified that these materials work at 150 atm at 350 ºC.
- Testing has involved:
	- Flowing corrosion loop for 1-2 months, fast flowing water and boiling
	- Stuck them in the MIT reactor for 6 months (albeit no heat flux)
	- Some of the materials from the paper didn't survey (e.g. zirconium nitride) didn't survive in the nuclear environment.
- The effect works primarily in regions where VdW forces dominate. These are typically high-temperature applications where the electrostatic interactions dissipate. So it's perfect for nuclear and other applications where the water is high-temperature and high-pressure.
- In other applications, if these specific coatings don't work, others probably would.
- They also did a study to investigate if you could coat every nuclear fuel rod in the country. It would cost $5-7 per rod. The value created would be approximately $10 per rod.
- Commercialization next steps:
	- For each potential market, estimate: how much value would this add?
	- We know it adds value in nuclear, but the testing is hard. You need to get a reactor owner to take a risk and put this new material into their reactor for several years (Mike has made some progress with the [[Constellation Energy]] and the Candu Owners Group in Canada). Constellation provided $4M of research
	- For geothermal, the water is much more acidic (pH ~ 3). We are closer to reaching a deal with the commercial partner.
	- Where else? Apparently oil & gas (see Mike's conversation with Saudi Aramco)
- Timeframes:
	- If a coating lasts 4.5 years, it meets the criteria. But even if staves off CRUD formation for ~300 days, you may still avoid the tipping point where it becomes a problem.
- Applying the coating:
	- PVC for TiC
	- [Filtered cathodic vacuum arc deposition (FCVAD)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212827120315596) for the amorphous carbon and the diamond
- Who makes the nuclear fuel rods? [[Westinghouse]] and 2-3 other companies
- How expensive is it to build the coating equipment?
	- The design study showed that the machine would cost $10-20M

Note: A company called Nanofilms does all the anti-stick coatings for all Apple products. It's amorphous carbon. Mike believes you could use this technology to coat narrow-diameter components like heat exchanger pipes.
## Key people
[[Mike Short]]

## Technology Readiness Level (1-9)
- Patents got granted a few weeks ago. 
- Mike is trying to convince a fission plant to put this in a reactor for testing.

## Needs that this could potentially address
- [[Preventing fouling on heat transfer surfaces]]

## Tech specs
Works on any large heat exchanger above 200 ºC.

## Estimated time & cost to commercialize


## Outstanding risks
- Durability of the coatings at low pH
- Competition: according to [[Minhaj Malik]], people have done versions of this with CVD and tubes, PVD, ion vapor and related techniques. Solutions exist in the market.  
- Suitability to surface heat exchangers, where the coating would presumably need to be applied inside cylindrical tubes
