up::: [[Gaps in the geothermal industry]]

## Description of need
There is an opportunity to build a company that provides technology and equipment for deep geothermal drilling, including rugged gyrotrons, waveguides, as well as other equipment such as:
* [[Cements that cure at high temperatures]]
* [[Explosives that work at high temperatures]]
* [[Drilling electronics that operate at high temperatures]]

[[Carlos Araque]] from [[Quaise Energy]] confirms that one of the major gaps in the deep geothermal industry today is equipment that can reliably operate in deep, hot environments.
