## Description of venture idea
In a mature [[Nuclear fusion]] industry, there will be a strong need for systems to track flows and exchanges of tritium between countries or institutions. This is made more complex by the fact that tritium can be "lost" by becoming embedded in reactor materials, by leaking into the environment, or simply by natural radioactive decay.
