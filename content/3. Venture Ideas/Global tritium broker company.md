## Description of venture idea
Several major fusion projects will require a startup inventory of tritium. This is a scarce, hazardous gas with only a 12-year lifetime and export control limitations (see need: [[Tritium storage, transportation, and marketplace for startup inventory]]). A global broker for this fuel would make it easier for fusion projects to procure tritium.

## Market needs this venture would address
