## Description of venture idea
A home electric system that enables a seamless transition to V2H islanded mode without any loss of power or weird electrical transients.

## Market needs this venture would address
If your bidirectional EV charger is set up in Islanded Mode (not grid-interactive), and therefore does not have the ability to export power to the grid, then you don't need an interconnection study! But you need a physical transfer switch, and the main challenge is that transition time to backup. You will lose power for a few seconds.
