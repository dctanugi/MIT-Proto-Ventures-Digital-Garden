## Description of venture idea
Software that enables utility-scale energy project developers to perform their own "informational studies" to estimate the likelihood of ultimately getting interconnection approval from the grid operator for a given project site ("where should I put it?") and control configuration approach ("how should I configure and operate it?").

## Market needs this venture would address
For utility-scale project developers, lets them assess different project locations and different project control configurations, with the ultimate aim of enabling them to put together projects that are likely to get approved for interconnection with minimal network upgrades.

Some companies that act both as project developers and technology manufacturers (e.g. Tesla) are building this kind of solution in-house. But we suspect that regular developers aren't looking to develop such deep expertise in either operational control strategy or grid power flow modeling.

> [!NOTE] Note
> This question of "project control configuration" is especially relevant for energy storage projects  —  not so much for solar or wind.

## Differentiation
TBD

## Business model
- SaaS?
- Services firm that performs studies on behalf of developers, and advises them on optimal control configuration etc?

## Team


## Outstanding risks & critical hypotheses
- Is this different from [[Geo-mapping software platform to help energy developers optimize new project proposals]]?
- Utilities would be willing to share their network data with us so we can power these informational studies  
- Developers want to run this type of informational study, and they don't mind using a third-party platform for it
- This is a product company, not a consulting opportunity (is it?)
