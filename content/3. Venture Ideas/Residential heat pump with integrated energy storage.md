## Description of venture idea
Let's sell a residential heat pump with integrated energy storage. Maybe this is a Li-ion battery pack (5 kWh should suffice), or maybe this is a system where the heat pump overcools/heats the working the fluid in anticipation of an upcoming cooling/heating load. Either way, the point is that your heat pump consumes cheap power instead of expensive peak power to cool/heat your home.

## Market needs this venture would address
Residential heat pump market

## Technical capabilities this venture might leverage
- Li-ion batteries
- Thermal storage media
- TBD

## Business model
- OEM

## Team
None

## Outstanding risks
- Building an HVAC equipment business is a steep uphill. Requires distributor relationships, etc. Is there a better business model?
