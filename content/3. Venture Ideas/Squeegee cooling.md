## Description of capability
- It relies on the discontinuity in specific heat in materials as they transition between **superconducting** and **normal** state under the effect of a magnetic field. Materials lose their superconducting behavior when a strong enough magnetic field is applied.
- In one of those phases, Cooper pairs can form, and they act as bosons and can all occupy the same energy state.
- As a result, when you magnetize a superconductor, it gets *colder* in the process of going normal.  This is called the magnetocaloric effect.
- Initially switch on the magnetic field over the entire material, then open the heat switch to insulate the cold side, and then 'squeegee' the energy towards the hot side, and then open the heat switch on the cold side. This is a new thermodynamic cycle.
