## Description of venture idea
Purchase bulk lithium, separate Li6 from Li7, sell the Li7 at a discount on the regular lithium market, sell the Li6 at a premium to the military, or fusion companies, or maybe [[Kairos Power]].

Another motivation for this enrichment comes from John Ball's work on nuclear weapons proliferation risk from ARC-class reactors:
>It is also found that Li-6 enrichment strongly suppresses fissile breeding, providing a novel motivation for lithium enrichment in fusion systems.

## Market needs this venture would address
- Need for Li6 for military and fusion applications, as well as [[Small Modular Reactors]]
- Need for more affordable Li7 for battery market

## Technical capabilities this venture might leverage
