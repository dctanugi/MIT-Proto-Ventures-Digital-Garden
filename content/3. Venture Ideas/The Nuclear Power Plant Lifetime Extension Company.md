## Description of venture idea
Provide solutions that enable nuclear power plants to obtain lifetime extensions, for example by selling or leasing [[Portable transient grating spectroscopy device]]s for nuclear plant inspectors.

## Market needs this venture would address
[[Extending nuclear plant lifetimes]]

## Technical capabilities this venture might leverage
[[Transient grating spectroscopy (TGS)]]
[[Cyclotron proton source]]

## Business model
Equipment sales

## Team
[[Mike Short]]
[[Jonas Rajagopal]]

## Outstanding risks
- Competition: [[Minhaj Malik]] and [[AIman Khan]] argue that most of the major nuclear companies have entire business units focused on lifetime extension services.
- Longevity of venture: does this business become irrelevant in 25 years, once all existing nuclear plants have been retired?
- The nuclear regulation sector may not be willing to believe that elastic modulus and thermal diffusivity are reliable proxies for fracture toughness.
- TAM: big enough?
