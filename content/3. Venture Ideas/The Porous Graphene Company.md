## Description of venture idea
A materials platform company commercializing porous graphene for a variety of separation applications.

## Market needs this venture would address
- Candidate applications:
	- [[Cheaper Li-ion battery recycling processes]]
	- [[Novel ways of breaking down & sorting mining ore]] (esp. rare earths)
	- Water-Solvent filtration or Solvent-Solvent filtration

## Technical capabilities this venture might leverage
[[Porous graphene]]

## Business model
TBD

## Team
[[Rohit Karnik]]

## Outstanding risks
- Cost of graphene
- Typically, nanomaterials startups only succeed when high precision is not required (e.g. as bulk additives), since high precision stuff is difficult to scale up. Can this venture be designed to fall into that 'high precision not required' category?
