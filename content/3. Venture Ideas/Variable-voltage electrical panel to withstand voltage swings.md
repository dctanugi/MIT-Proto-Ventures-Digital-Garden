## Description of venture idea
What if your electrical panel could transform the power into individual circuits to lower voltages for circuits that are purely analog and resistive (e.g. your toaster oven or your space heater), while working to maintain exactly 110 V for your circuits that are powering digital equipment like a desktop computer?

This would enable your home to better withstand a power grid with wildly fluctuating voltage, and/or to reduce its power consumption at key times without having to turn anything _off_, simply by lowering the voltage for appliances that can withstand this.
