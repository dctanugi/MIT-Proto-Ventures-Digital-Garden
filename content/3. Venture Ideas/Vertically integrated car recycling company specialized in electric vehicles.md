## Description of Venture Idea
We see an opportunity to create a new type of vertically integrated car recycling company specializing in [[Electric vehicles]] (EVs). Why?
1. Structural inefficiencies in today's car recycling industry
	- The current recycling industry is fragmented, with dismantling and shredding typically performed by separate entities.
	- Car shredders receive a wide mix of vehicles, often pre-crushed, which makes precise material recovery challenging.
	- A vertically integrated company handling both dismantling and recycling would unlock efficiencies, such as pre-sorting components like batteries, specialty metals, and electronic systems before shredding.
1. Unique challenges posed by end-of-life EVs (EoL EVs)
	- EVs differ significantly from traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) cars due to their higher content of specialty alloys, critical minerals (e.g., lithium, cobalt), and complex electronic components.
	- Existing car recyclers lack effective methods for recovering and separating these materials.
	- Since EVs will remain a minority of EoL cars in the short term, traditional recyclers are unlikely to adapt processes specifically for EVs.
	- This creates an opportunity for a niche recycler specializing in EoL EVs, offering tailored dismantling and recycling processes for maximum material recovery and value extraction.

## Market Needs This Venture Would Address
1. [[Cost-effective recycling solutions for electric vehicles]]
	- Recover valuable materials such as lithium, cobalt, rare earth elements, and specialty alloys more efficiently than current methods.
	- Address growing concerns about the environmental and economic impacts of critical material shortages.
2. Better alignment with sustainability goals
	- Enable automakers to meet regulations on extended producer responsibility (EPR) and material circularity.
3. Support for scaling EV adoption
    - Provide a reliable, efficient pathway for recycling EoL EVs, addressing concerns about battery and component disposal.

## Technical Capabilities This Venture Might Leverage
1. Advanced materials separation technologies
	- Techniques such as hydrometallurgy, pyrometallurgy, and solvent extraction to recover critical materials.
    - Novel processes for separating specialty alloys used in EV batteries, motors, and structural components.
2. Digital tracking and disassembly tools
    - Use of digital twins or AI-based systems to optimize dismantling workflows and track material flows.
3. Innovative EV dismantling systems
    - Robotics or automation to efficiently separate components like batteries, wiring harnesses, and e-motors from vehicle shells.
4. Efficient logistics and reverse supply chain management
    - Systems to optimize the collection and transportation of EoL EVs to minimize costs and carbon footprint.

## Business Model
- Buy EoL EVs: Acquire vehicles directly from consumers, automakers (as part of their EPR programs), and other sources.
- Recover valuable materials: Dismantle EVs to extract high-value components and materials.
- Sell output streams:
    - Traditional streams: ferrous metals, aluminum, and plastics.
    - Novel streams: battery-grade materials (e.g., lithium, cobalt, nickel), rare earth elements, and high-purity specialty alloys.
- Revenue opportunities:
    - Selling materials to battery recyclers or refiners.
    - Partnerships with automakers seeking closed-loop recycling solutions for EV production.

## Outstanding Risks

1. End-of-life EV availability
	- The market for EoL EVs may grow more slowly than anticipated, delaying the ventureâ€™s scaling.
2. Transportation costs
    - Moving EoL EVs from dispersed locations to recycling facilities could be expensive, impacting profitability.
3. Technological uncertainty
    - Emerging recycling technologies may underperform or fail to scale.
4. Regulatory landscape
    - Changes in regulations could either help or hinder operations, particularly regarding waste management and material recovery standards.
