## Business model
Kyoto Fusioneering focuses on the fuel cycle and on the breeder blanket, and they want to sell those solutions to reactor companies like [[Commonwealth Fusion Systems]] or [[General Atomics]]. They would like the reactor companies to focus on the plasma. Richard Pearson's analogy is that the reactor companies will be like Boeing or Airbus (make and sell airplanes), and Kyoto Fusioneering will be like Rolls-Royce (make sell engines to Boeing and Airbus). He expects that the reactor companies will eventually function like the Areva and Westinghouse in the nuclear fission sector, but that this will take a long time.
