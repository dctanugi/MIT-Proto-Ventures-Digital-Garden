## About

John is a professor of mechanical engineering at MIT. He specializes in additive manufacturing. He is also the co-founder of [[Desktop Metal]] and [[Vulcan Forms]].

One of John's project involves achieving locally-defined composition (on the order of 100 Âµm) in a metallic component. Initially started for the ULTIMATE program in the context of turbines, but this could be applied to fusion materials as well. See patent: [Additive manufacturing by spatially controlled material fusion](https://patents.google.com/patent/US11602792B2/en)
