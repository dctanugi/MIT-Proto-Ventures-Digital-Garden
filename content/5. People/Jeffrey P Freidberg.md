## About
Jeff is a theoretical plasma physicist.

He is now a retired professor at MIT, but still working part time (50%).

He doesn't have his own research group anymore. He still teaches occasionally, but he focuses primarily on the science (not administrative matters).

For most of his career, Jeff focused on MHD equilibrium and stability in magnetic confinement fusion. As far as he is concerned, the US MHD community has done its job: we have found a couple configurations that have reasonable parameters: tokamaks and stellarators. 

Jeff supports the [[Liquid sandwich vacuum vessel]] project, with his graduate student Joseph. But most of the challenges are on the materials front.

His other big project has been [[Magnetohydrodynamic generators|MHD generators]], with [[Samuel Frank]].

## How we met
