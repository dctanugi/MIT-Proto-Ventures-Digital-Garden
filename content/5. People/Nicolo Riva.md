## About
Nico was a postdoc at [[MIT Plasma Science & Fusion Center|PSFC]].  He was collaborating with [[Proxima Fusion]], [[Type One Energy]] (T1E) and [[Commonwealth Fusion Systems ]](CFS) on magnets for fusion (e.g. SPARC, STARBLAZER). His task is to evaluate the risks in the use of [[REBCO superconducting material]] HTS for fusion magnets using numerical simulations and experiments.

He led the HTS modeling work group: https://www.htsmodelling.com/
