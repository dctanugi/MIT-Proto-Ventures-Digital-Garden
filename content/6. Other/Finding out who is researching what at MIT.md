- [Dimensions Analytics](https://libguides.mit.edu/dimanalytics) is a great database for publications, grants, and patents. You can limit your search to MIT outputs using the 'Research Organization' filter.
- Patents: [PatSnap](https://analytics-patsnap-com.libproxy.mit.edu/search/input/simple#/simple) is a good patent database that lets you filter for MIT patents. The [MIT Technology Licensing Office](https://tlo.mit.edu/industry-entrepreneurs/available-technologies) also has a searchable list of relevant MIT inventions. Dimension Analytics also lets you search for MIT patents.
- The [MIT Industrial Liaison Program](https://ilp.mit.edu/research) has a searchable database of short profiles of individual research groups and projects. You can also search MIT [News](https://news.mit.edu/) & [Events Calendar](https://calendar.mit.edu/) for researcher profiles, seminars, and talks related to your topic area.
- Funding awards: [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/), [ARPA-E](https://arpa-e.energy.gov/technologies/projects), [Dept of Energy](https://pamspublic.science.energy.gov/WebPAMSExternal/interface/awards/AwardSearchExternal.aspx) all have searchable databases of funding awards. Dimensions Analytics also lets you search for funding awards.
- To visualize clusters of researchers who frequently work together on a topic, you can explore the [MIT Collaboration Tool](http://collaboration.mit.edu/search/energy)

The MIT librarians (especially Howard Silver and Nicholas Albaugh) are also available to help with these kinds of explorations.
