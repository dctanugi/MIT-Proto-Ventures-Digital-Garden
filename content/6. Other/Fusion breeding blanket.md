Neutrons must be captured in the [[Fusion breeding blanket|breeder blanket]] in order to:
- shield the magnets
- capture heat
- breed tritium

In the [[SPARC tokamak|SPARC]] reactor, [[FLiBe]] is being considered as a liquid blanket material. Unfortunately, FLiBe poses health and environmental risks.

According to the [[2023 Fusion Fuel Cycle & Blanket Roadmap Workshop]], the KPIs for [[Fusion breeding blanket|breeder blanket]]s are:
1. Tritium breeding ratio > 1
2. Timeline: Final design by 2028-2032 to enable [[A Fusion Pilot Plant (FPP) by 2035]]
3. Low activation: neutron activation will create large amounts of radionuclide inventories. Need to optimize for safety, waste volume minimization, and maintenance.
