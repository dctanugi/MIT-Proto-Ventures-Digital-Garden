[[Matt Trevithick]] recommends leading an MIT study that anonymously asks all the fusion private companies what components they would like to purchase in 3-5 years, the tech specs those components need to meet, how much they would buy, and how much they would pay for it.

This would enable us to list a set of RFPs of sorts, and would help inform the creation of startups to meet these needs (or motivate incumbent corporations to start developing products for fusion companies).

[[Francesca Ferrazza]] is very much thinking about the fusion supply chain.
- Need pumps, detection systems, coatings, maintenance systems, gloveboxes, membranes, valves, water detritiation systems, etc.
- We're talking about high-volume manufacturing, scalability, standards, certifications, etc. Not one-time boutique shops.
