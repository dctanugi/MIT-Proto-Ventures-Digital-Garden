According to Sandri et al., at the end of the (plant) operations it takes several tens of years to reach radioactivity concentrations of less than 1 Bq/g.[1]

However, they add that fusion waste is “very low” or “low” activity, unlike fission which produces medium or high activity waste.

Next wave of innovations:
1. Heat and tritium recovery (e.g. [[LIBRA - Liquid Immersion Blanket, Robust (Tritium) Accountancy|LIBRA]])
2. Conversion to energy products, e.g. ammonia
3. Materials prototyping and testing (e.g. [[Cyclotron proton source]], [[Understanding materials degradation in a deuterium-tritium fusion environment]], and [[magnet]]
4. Education and outreach
