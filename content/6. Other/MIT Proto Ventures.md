Proto Ventures is MITâ€™s venture studio. Created in 2018 by the MIT Innovation Initiative, Proto Ventures is a new model for entrepreneurship and venture building at MIT that identifies the innovative people, ideas, and technologies from across the MIT campus and brings them together to create new pathways for talent and transformative technology ventures.

In April 2023, I started working as a [[MIT Venture Builder - Fusion & Clean Energy]] at MIT Proto Ventures.
