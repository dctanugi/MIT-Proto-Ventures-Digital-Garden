## Major challenges in fusion energy
Note: this list of challenges is a work in progress, like the rest of this website.
### Burning plasma challenges:
- burn control
- burning plasma self-organization
- alpha particleâ€“magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) mode interactions
- divertor physics
- disruption prediction and mitigation (see [[A fusion vacuum vessel that can withstand plasma disruptions]])
### Supply chain challenges:
- Global availability of tritium and beryllium
- Availability of [[REBCO superconducting material]]
- Domestic availability of large-scale capacitors and semiconductors
### Other challenges:
- De-tritiation of solid components
## Opportunities in fusion energy
According to [David Kirtley](https://www.mcjcollective.com/my-climate-journey-podcast/david-kirtley), technological developments that are paving the way for the feasibility of fusion include advanced computing, high speed gigahertz fiber optics, and large semiconductors for high-power pulse power systems. Companies like [[Commonwealth Fusion Systems]] are also built on the development of [[High-temperature superconducting magnets|HTS magnets]]. See also: [[Commercial fusion opportunity map]].
