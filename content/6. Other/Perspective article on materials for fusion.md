Title: Materials for Fusion Energy: Key Challenges and Guiding Principles for Developing Under High Design Uncertainty

Abstract:
Fusion energy is at an important inflection point in its development: multiple government agencies and private companies are now planning fusion pilot plants to deliver electricity to the grid in the next decade. However, realizing fusion as a technically and economically viable energy source depends on developing and qualifying materials that can withstand the extreme environment inside a fusion power plant. This Perspective seeks to engage the materials science community in this effort. We first outline the principal materials challenges and research opportunities for fusion. Next, we argue that fusion is distinct from other energy applications with respect to materials, not just in the magnitude and complexity of the technical challenges but also in the present level of uncertainty in materials design requirements. To address this, we finally propose a research framework based on an iterative co-evolution of materials science and fusion power plant design requirements.
