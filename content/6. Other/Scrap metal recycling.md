## Industry structure
- Processors and brokers (e.g. peddlers) collect and purchase scrap, and separate it into various ISRI-specified categories. Note: metal producers typically operate their own feed yeards.
- They sell these materials to a steel mill, steel shredding plant, aluminum/non-ferrous secondary smelter, and/or another type of secondary metal scrap processor such as a wire chopping plant.

## Needs in the scrap metal recycling industry:
- [[Fast, automated inbound material identification (IMI) and inspection for metal scrap yards]]: must be very fast!
- [[Market price-dependent processing and sorting of metal scrap]]
- [[Preventing Li-ion battery fires in scrap yards and recycling plants]]
