In response to the fact that [[It's challenging to build a technology company for the fusion industry]], [[Sam Wurzel]] suggests several strategies:
- Be willing to change your product or service based on customer need
- Find early fusion _and_ non-fusion niches that pay. Generate revenue ASAP.
- Focus attention inward to fusion industry.
- Don't go crazy with patents. They expire after 20 years, and they're expensive.
- Build relationships.
- Go beyond letters of intent. Get paying contracts!
- Take a portfolio approach. Spread the risk.
- DoE R&D Centers once they are appropriated
