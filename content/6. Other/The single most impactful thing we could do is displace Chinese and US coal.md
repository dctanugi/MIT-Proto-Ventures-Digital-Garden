According to [[Ken Hersh]], in order to avert the worst effects of climate change, the only thing that matters is quickly stopping coal consumption from the US and [[China]] (even if it's replacing it with [[natural gas]]). Decarbonizing the US and Europe doesn't make a difference relative to the growth of emissions in emerging economies.

[[Ken Hersh]] envisions doing this by building a serie1s of large combined cycle natural gas plants in China, using existing technology and processes. These plants take only 18 months to come online, according to him.
