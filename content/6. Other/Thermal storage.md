## Companiew
### Companies storing cold:
- [Calmac](https://www.trane.com/commercial/north-america/us/en/products-systems/energy-storage-solutions/calmac-model-a-tank.html) (now part of HVAC giant Trane) has been commercially active for decades freezing tanks of liquid to help cool large commercial buildings. 
- [Thule Energy Storage](https://www.thuleenergystorage.com/projects/) has some 1,500 ​“Ice Bear” units freezing ice to cool down houses and small businesses. (It picked up the IP from startup Ice Energy, which went [bankrupt in 2020](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/thermal-storage-evangelist-ice-energy-files-for-bankruptcy).)
- [Viking Cold Solutions](https://www.vikingcold.com/) does the same for cold-storage warehouses, making them more energy efficient while improving the quality of frozen foods. 
- Five-year-old startup [Nostromo Energy](https://www.nostromo.energy/) has operated its IceBrick product for commercial buildings in Israel for more than two years; now it’s in the running for a [$189 million loan guarantee](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230104005252/en/Nostromo-Energy-Reaches-Key-Application-Milestone-for-189-Million-Loan-Guarantee-from-the-U.S.-Department-of-Energy-to-Deploy-275-MWh-of-Distributed-Energy-Storage-Systems) from the U.S. Department of Energy to install it at 120 buildings in Southern California and beyond.

## Challenges
According to [Canary Media](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/5-reasons-why-thermal-storage-may-finally-be-set-to-take-off):
>Building owners just haven’t felt compelled to shift their heating and cooling loads, even if they theoretically could save some money on their energy bills. [Analyses of the thermal-storage industry](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/how-does-thermal-energy-storage-reach-scale#gs.FxM29Bw) from a few years ago concluded it was a good idea in search of a receptive audience.
