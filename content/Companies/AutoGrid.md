The founder was a Stanford professor. He had the insight that many energy companies want an IoT platform to collect the telemetry. The hardware is all third-party. Software to help you visualize the production of your assets, forecast consumption, etc. Shell used this for power trading: they needed a single interface where they would see all their data. They made it easy for energy companies to aggregate their energy data in a single place and to run compute on top of it.
