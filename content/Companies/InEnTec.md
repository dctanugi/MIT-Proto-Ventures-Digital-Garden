InEnTech was founded by [[Daniel R Cohn]]. They focus on plastics recycling and low-cost distributed hydrogen fuel production using plasma gasification. 

The main technology is gasification: you take waste (organic waste or organic + inorganic waste). If the organic waste is biomass, you gasify it, produce a syngas (hydrogen + CO). From there, you can make just about any chemical or fuel. And if the biomass is from a renewable source, then this syngas is renewable!

Previously, the company looked at hazardous waste, but now they focus on municipal waste.

There is a pre-processor system that does most of the gasification (called a down-drive gasifier). Then they use graphite electrodes (not plasma torches, which are shorter lifetime and less rugged). They use arcs (like in an arc furnace) and vitrification for inorganics. 

Other applications:
- They can also recycle wind turbine blades.
- They can also take natural gas and convert it into hydrogen.
- They have IP on hydrogen-boosted gasification (the waste has 2 H's for each C, whereas you need 4 H's for each C to make fuels).
- They can also recycle plastic.
