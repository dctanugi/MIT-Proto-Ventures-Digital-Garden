The Jameel Investment Management Company (JIMCO) is the active global investment arm of the Jameel Family (see [[Mohammed Jameel]]).

From [[2024-01-04 Kaan Adanir]]:
- [[Jameel Investment Management Co]] is a Corporate Venture Group for investing in startups. The family's core business is ALG Holdings - a lot of auto distribution business. Close ties with [[Toyota]] and with [[MIT]].
- Four Jameel projects at MIT:
	- J-WAFS
	- J-PAL
	- J-CLINIC
	- J-Something
- [[Mohammed Jameel]] met with the founder of [[Rivian]] when he was still at MIT. They were the first investor in [[Rivian]]. They have invested $300M in it.
- ALG Holdings is looking to diversify their business. Their interests include:
	- Automotive
	- Power generation (e.g. recently acquired FRV, invested in [[Commonwealth Fusion Systems|CFS]] and [[Found Energy]] and [[Lilac Solutions]] and [[The Engine]])
	- Fusion
- [[Mohammed Jameel]] is a huge supporter of [[Nuclear fusion]], so they've supported [[General Fusion]] and [[Kyoto Fusioneering]] in addition to [[Commonwealth Fusion Systems|CFS]].
- They are looking at ways they can facilitate even earlier stage tech to the point where they could be spun out and JIMCO could potentially help there as well. [[MIT Proto Ventures]] appears as it could be part of that process and JIMCO would like to learn more.
- Their check size for fusion is very large. They invest in early stage (pre-seed or beyond). First check size $250k - $3M, and then they typically keep filling out follow-on funding rounds.
- They also invest in VC funds ([[DCVC]], [[The Engine]], Kleiner Perkins, Bessemer...).
- They don't necessarily act as a corporate VC. They don't usually invest for strategic reasons; the main rationale is financial.
- They also have a newco arm as well.
- In MENA, they only invest in fintech and e-commerce, not deep tech.
