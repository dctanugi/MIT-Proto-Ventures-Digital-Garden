Three tools:
1. A tool to infer plasma properties from spectroscopy emission spectra. Features:
	- Automated workflow
	- Command-line tool
	- State of the art physics models
	- Rigorously quantified uncertainty.
2. Prospector: A data analysis tool for clustering and visualization
	1. [[General Fusion]] has ~10k shots with 100s of diagnostics per shot.
	2. A fully integrated backend library (`fgets`) to extract features from your data, then visualize it.
	3. A hierarchical clusterizer with customizable metrics
	4. "Here's a shot I like a lot. What are some shots that are similar to it? What features do they have in common?"
	5. A 2D/3D projection maps
3. Fusion control regressor: a predictive analytics tool
	1. Full browser interactive GUI frontend
	2. Forecast your trial outcomes, or invert it to design experiments based on desired outcomes
	3. Used deep neural networks, transforms, attention modules, augmentation techniques like diffusion models, etc.
