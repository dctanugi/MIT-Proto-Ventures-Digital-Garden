Virtual Peaker is a [[Virtual Power Plants]] company based in Kentucky. They're helping utilities like Vermont’s [[Green Mountain Power]] control thermostats, water heaters, batteries and EVs to balance the grid.

They offer a cloud-based software platform that’s being used by more than a dozen U.S. utilities to connect to, communicate with and provide real-time control over a wide range of household devices.

They are similar in a way to [[Uplight]], [[EnergyHub]], and [[AutoGrid]]. But they don't manage programs for utilities; they are purely [[SaaS]].

They also offer an [[energy demand forecasting]] product for utilities.
