Zettelkastens and wikis different in a few key ways:
- The main purpose of a [[wiki]] is to store information in a way that can easily be retrieved. In contrast, the main purpose of a [[Zettelkasten]] is to help create new connection between ideas
- Most wiki pages are about an entity like a person, a place, a software language, a book, etc. In contrast, most Zettels are atomic notes about a single idea.
- Wikis are typically designed to be shared. Zettelkastens are intended primarily for yourself.
