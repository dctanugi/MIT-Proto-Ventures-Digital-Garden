- [[Y Combinator]] has a call for adaptation startups: https://www.ycombinator.com/blog/rfs-climatetech/#climate-adaptation. Some of the specific ideas that speak to me personally:
	- Methane monitoring
	- Mesh sensor networks
	- Better data, models & risk mitigation for insurance
	- Home protection & hardening
	- Faster, more ubiquitous detection
	- Better ways to reduce or eliminate powerline ignitions
	- Groundwater monitoring, management, and remediation
	- Better approaches to applying floodwater to groundwater recharge
- [[Alex Laplaza]] listed the following customer segments for adaptation startups:
	- Insurance companies (they need help quantifying risk)
	- Other financial players (also need to adjust for risk when making investments). That includes 'transition risk' (e.g. if you're investing in a new LNG terminal) but also physical risk.
	- Landholders and real estate owners, both to protect them from physical damage (e.g. fireproof your home), to reduce the risk of physical damage (for example, Lowercarbon invested in [[Burnbot]], which does controlled wildfires), and to warn them about possible physical damage. 
	- Companies that need reliable access to water and electricity
- [[Kerri Cahoy]] is working on:
	- More accurate flood risk maps and sea level rise maps (e.g. for insurance companies and real estate developers, reinsurance companies, municipal governments)
	- (Note: there is apparently an industry need for [[Low-cost, timely, high-resolution satellite imagery]].)
	- Preventing wildfires from power lines
