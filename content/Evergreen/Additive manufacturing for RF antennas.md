## Description of capability
[[Andrew Seltzman]] has done a lot of work on the manufacturing of [[Lower hybrid current drive (LHCD)]] components for [[Nuclear fusion]], particularly the launchers (which direct the RF waves and are hidden, in his design, behind the tungsten tiles in the scrape-off layer contacting the plasma). In particular:
	- The use of metal [[Additive manufacturing]] with high-strength alloys
	- Special metal alloys that don't contain any high-activation elements like Nb (see [[Low-activation materials]])
	- Post-processing like welding and polishing for an optimal waveguide performance
