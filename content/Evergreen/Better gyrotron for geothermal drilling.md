## Description of capability
Gyrotrons for geothermal drilling (e.g. [[Quaise Energy]]) operate at ~100 GHz. Technically, 100 GHz does not require [[REBCO superconducting material]]: NbSn is good enough. But the commercial deployment of gyrotrons for [[Geothermal energy]] will require higher wall plug efficiency, greater device durability, and simpler cooling. [[Dennis Whyte]] believes that the use of [[REBCO superconducting material]] can enable this!
