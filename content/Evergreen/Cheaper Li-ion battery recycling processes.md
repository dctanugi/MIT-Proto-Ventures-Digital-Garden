## Solutions today, and their shortcomings
- Established methods are highly energy-intensive and involve burning used batteries at more than 1,400 ºC. 
- Most lithium-ion batteries are sent to waste management facilities or landfills.  
- The leading recycling method involves smelting discarded batteries or dissolving them in harsh chemicals to remove the binder and recover metals such as cobalt, nickel and copper as a metal alloy.
