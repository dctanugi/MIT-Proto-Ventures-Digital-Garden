[[Daniel R Cohn]] started working with [[John B. Heywood]] (MIT MechE professor) who does internal combustion research, and spun out a company called [[Ethanol Boosting Systems]] with Ford Motor Company. The relationship did not go well: the spinoff company feels that Ford is infringing on these patents in F-150 trucks. A litigation is in process.

The company's capabilities include potentially running a car (or a boat) on methanol.

This might also include [[Daniel R Cohn]]'s work on [[Cleaner gasoline engines for heavy-duty vehicles]].
