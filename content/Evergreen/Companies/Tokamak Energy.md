## About
Tokamak Energy is a [[Nuclear fusion]] power plant company. They are commercializing the [[Spherical tokamak]] concept and also position themselves as leaders in [[High-temperature superconducting magnets|HTS magnets]].

## Roadmap
Tokamak Energy aims to have a commercial power plant ("ST-E1") in the mid-2030s, consistent with [[A Fusion Pilot Plant (FPP) by 2035]].

Their proof of concept, dubbed, ST80-HTS, has a build completion planned in 202.  will be the worldâ€™s first high field spherical tokamak to demonstrate the full potential of high temperature superconducting magnets.

## Partnerships
In 2023, Tokamak Energy partnered with [[Sumitomo Corporation]]. Sumitomo aims to "establish itself as a global market-leader for financing, construction and operation of fusion power plants".

They are also DoE Milestone funding recipients, in collaboration with [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]], to assess the impact of helium produced by neutron activation on structural materials ([source](https://www.tokamakenergy.co.uk/2023/08/03/tokamak-energy-awarded-eighth-infuse-grant-by-united-states-doe/)).
