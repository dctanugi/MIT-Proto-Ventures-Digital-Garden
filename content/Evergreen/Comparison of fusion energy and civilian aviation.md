From [[Bob Mumgaard]] at the [All-In Summit: Nuclear fusion and the potential for energy abundance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIPULlqA5Wc&t=662s)
1. Concept produces actually fully ionized plasmas (Paper airplane)
2. The plasma can be heated (1 keV electrons) (Montgolfier brothers)
3. The plasma approaches fusion conditions (triple product > 1E19 keV/m3/s) (Manned gliders)
4. Net gain energy is demonstrated (Q>1) (Wright brothers)
5. Net electricity is produced (Douglas)
6. Plant has competitive LCOE (Boeing)
