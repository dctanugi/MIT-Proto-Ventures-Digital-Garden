## Description of venture idea
Someone really ought to solve C&D waste. Just grind up the rubble and use it as an aggregate in concrete! If there is a concern about the mechanical integrity of the original concrete, maybe there is a blockchain system to keep track of where each bunch of C&D waste came from, and why the building was torn down (and confirm that this particular aggregate didn't come from a building that was torn down due to structural integrity problems).

## Market needs this venture would address
- Demolition companies need a cheaper and more sustainable way to deal with demolition waste
- Construction companies need a cheaper and more sustainable source of aggregate for their concrete

## Technical capabilities this venture might leverage
- Distributed ledger technology to keep track of what came from where
- Mechanical system to pulverize demolition waste into concrete aggregate

## Business model
TBD

## Team
None

## Outstanding risks
