According to Aditya Kumar from GE Vernova, the needs for control system innovations for [[Nuclear fusion]] include:
- Modeling for control:
	- Need real-time capable transient models for model-based plant control
	- Need fast, robust transient model and model validation
	- Need to be modular, configurable, physics-based, and parametrizable
- Sensing needs:
	- Harsh environments
	- Includes virtual sensors
- Digital twins, virtual sensing, controls
	- Tracking of plant health degredation of key components
- Marry physics-based and data-based techniques for the control of components whose physics is too complex
- AI/ML for health monitoring and fault diagnostics (including fault isolation)
- Cyber-physical society
	- OT security: cyberattack detection, isolation, neutralization ([[Digital Ghost]])
