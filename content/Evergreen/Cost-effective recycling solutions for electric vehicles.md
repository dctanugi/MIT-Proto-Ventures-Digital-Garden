## Description of Need

The rapid adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) has created an urgent need for effective recycling solutions for end-of-life EVs. Recycling is critical for recovering valuable materials like lithium, cobalt, and rare earth elements from batteries and other components. Existing recycling processes are either inefficient, costly, or not designed for the unique challenges posed by EVs, leading to significant waste of materials and higher environmental impact.

A cost-effective recycling solution would:
- Recover high-value materials efficiently.
- Reduce reliance on mining for critical minerals.
- Support a sustainable and circular economy for EVs.
- Help automakers meet regulatory requirements for extended producer responsibility (EPR).

## Problem Severity (1-10)

8

- Environmental impact: High levels of waste and pollution result from inadequate recycling processes, harming sustainability goals.
- Material scarcity: Critical materials like lithium and cobalt are expensive and finite, making recycling essential for long-term EV growth.
- Regulatory pressure: Governments worldwide are tightening regulations on material circularity, placing automakers at risk of penalties without proper recycling.

## Who Has This Need

1. Automakers
    - Obligated to meet EPR regulations and sustainability commitments.
    - Need cost-effective recycling pathways to avoid material shortages and rising costs.
2. Recyclers and Waste Management Companies
    - Struggle to profitably recover materials from EVs due to technological and economic barriers.
3. Governments and Policy Makers
    - Seeking scalable solutions to reduce the environmental footprint of EVs and ensure material circularity.
4. Consumers
    - Indirectly impacted by the higher costs of EV production and disposal.
5. Battery Manufacturers
    - Require recycled raw materials to meet supply chain demands sustainably.

## Solutions Today, and Their Shortcomings

1. Current Solutions
    - Pyrometallurgy: High energy consumption and carbon emissions; limited recovery of specific materials like lithium.
    - Hydrometallurgy: Lower emissions but costly due to chemical use and waste management.
    - Mechanical recycling: Incomplete material separation and recovery.
2. Shortcomings
    - Cost-prohibitive: Current methods are not economically viable at scale for many recyclers.
    - Inefficient recovery: Valuable materials are lost or degraded during processing.
    - Limited infrastructure: Lack of specialized facilities capable of handling EV-specific materials.
    - Fragmentation: No integrated processes to handle both dismantling and material recovery.
