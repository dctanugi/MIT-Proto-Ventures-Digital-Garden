## Description of need
Quantum computers needs to run at ~10 mK, and can't tolerate large magnetic fields (like the ones required for competing technologies like nuclear demagnetization refrigeration or adiabatic magnetization refrigeration)

## Problem severity (1-10)

## Who has this need

## Total addressable market (TAM)

## Solutions today, and their shortcomings
Dilution refrigeration is one of the only technologies available for cooling in the mK range. It relies on a mixture of helium-3 and helium-4. There are several drawbacks:
	- Helium-3 is actually becoming a scarce material.
	- Large energy consumption
	- Large spatial footprint for equipment

## Potentially relevant capabilities
[[Squeegee cooling]]
