## Description of need
Data center developers (especially hyperscalers) want to deploy new sites right now, but they don't expect to have technologies for the next 5+ years to meet their own energy needs. In the meantime, they'd love to be able to offer energy efficiency and demand flexibility to the utility. This is unsolved, according to Briana Kobor, at Head of Energy Market Innovation at Google.
