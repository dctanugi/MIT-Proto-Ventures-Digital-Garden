## Description of need

## Problem severity (1-10)

## Who has this need

## Total addressable market (TAM)

## Solutions today, and their shortcomings
- The [[SPARC tokamak|SPARC]] approach to tritium recovery is combined electrolysis catalytic exchange (CECE). That system only recovers 2-3 Ci per day, which is insufficient.
- [[Kurion]] (ACQ: [[Veolia]]) developed a modular detritiation system ([source](https://www.environmentalleader.com/2016/02/kurion-system-gives-nuclear-site-operators-new-tool-to-manage-tritium))
