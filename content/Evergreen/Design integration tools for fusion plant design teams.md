## Description of need
According to [[Mohamad Abdallah]] at [[Tokamak Energy]], tokamaks are *integration* challenges, so a key set of techniques to deploy requirements and establish key interfaces is needed. Right now, the interfaces between the different system teams and their requirements is inefficient and messy.

## Problem severity (1-10)
4

## Who has this need
Fusion companies

## Total addressable market (TAM)
Unknown

## Solutions today, and their shortcomings
A short list of open-source fusion software ([source](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/al6hgoiz471ci08/AAB-Bw9Ri9iwB96y01LIuwO4a?dl=0&preview=20230821creelyWartCompSummerSchoolLowRes.pptx)):
- HEAT (Developed by Tom Looby): Calculates heat fluxes: https://github.com/plasmapotential/HEAT
- SPARC Profiles: https://github.com/cfs-energy/SPARCPublic
- RADAS: Reads OpenADAS data to produce radiation curves: https://github.com/cfs-energy/radas
- OpenMC
- FreeGS: Time-independent equilibrium calculations: https://github.com/freegs-plasma/freegs
- Cfspopcon: Rapid scoping of scenarios using empirical relationships
- FISPACT-II: Multiphysics, inventory and source-term code system (by [[UK Atomic Energy Authority]])

List of proprietary tools developed by [[Commonwealth Fusion Systems]] ([source](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/al6hgoiz471ci08/AAB-Bw9Ri9iwB96y01LIuwO4a?dl=0&preview=20230821creelyWartCompSummerSchoolLowRes.pptx)):
- neutrino: Plasma control software
- MOSAIC: Collaborative scenario development framework linking several tool
- NRad: Neutronics (including predicting the activation of materials, waste classification, and Shut-Down Dose Rates)
