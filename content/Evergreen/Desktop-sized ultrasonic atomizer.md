## Description of capability
A desktop-sized gas atomizer that makes a few grams, not a few kg, for iterative development of new metal powder alloys.

Key components:
- Chamber for inert environment
- Ultrasonic transducer with graphite cantilever.
- Powder dispensers that feed into a melt area
- Tungsten inert gas (TIG) melter
## Key people
[[Andrei-Alexandru Popa]] and [[Andrew Seltzman]]

## Technology Readiness Level (1-9)
1

## Needs that this could potentially address
[[Small-batch production of metal powder alloys for new alloy development]]

## Tech specs
Makes a few grams of powders consisting of spherical particles in the 15-50 Âµm size range.

## Estimated time & cost to commercialize
$10K to first prototype. [[Formlabs]] is a good representative example of this kind of company.

## Outstanding risks
