## Description of venture idea
 IoT sensors talk to a hub via LoRaWan, and the hub uses representation learning to determine whether any of the information from the IoT sensors is worth triggering an alert. Only an alert is triggered does the hub broadcast the information further to the "mothership", e.g. via Starlink satellite connection.

The IoT sensors are powered by solar PV + batteries.
