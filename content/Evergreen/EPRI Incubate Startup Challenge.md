### Customer and community engagement
Customers and their satisfaction lie at the core of any business. As an industry, we want to be more proactive to better serve our customers, particularly those who are vulnerable or disadvantaged, provide more personalized communications and information, and offer services and solutions targeted to individual needs. Bring us your solutions that help us create grid-interactive smart communities, enable broad community benefit, and support economic development. These solutions help our customers become more proactive and informed participants in a cleaner, more integrated, and resilient energy system, and create new lines of business for our utilities.

### Decarbonization and Sustainability
The world is on a path to decarbonize and the electric power industry is leading the charge. Since 2005, the US reduced its carbon footprint one gigaton, primarily by switching to cleaner fuels, expanding renewables, and driving efficiencies. To get the next gigaton, we need solutions to integrate and manage more low-carbon energy generation: from distributed to utility-scale solutions covering wind, solar, hydro, nuclear, and low-carbon fuels; to systems that help us optimize their output. Circularity in our operations and materials also are critical. As we deploy these solutions, controls, financing, accounting systems, and materials technology options will help society better track environmental impacts and support a shift to zero carbon. Our path to deep decarbonization also includes a focus on low-carbon hydrogen technologies.

### Electric mobility
Electrification is a key component of our decarbonization strategy, and transportation represents our biggest emitter. To get a gigaton out of transportation, we need solutions to enable low-cost, ubiquitous, and manageable charging, comprehensive fleet-as-a-service solutions, and charging infrastructure wherever we drive and park. And as adoption scales, we need the ability to manage charging and to call on vehicles to switch from energy consumer to supplier and back depending on the need.

### Electrification
Building systems and commercial/industrial processes represent significant opportunities for decarbonization. Utilities have long been active in innovations around building envelopes, device efficiencies, and demand response programs. As we add intelligence, load disaggregation and flexible load solutions, we help match energy consumption to grid availability without sacrificing comfort or performance. As these solutions become more integrated and complex, there also is a need for comprehensive Electrification-as-a-Service solutions that guide customers through the design, deployment, and operation of solutions.

### Nuclear assists
Nuclear power will play a critical role in the decarbonization of the electric generation sector. Many models show the need for both existing nuclear power plants, as well as new advanced reactors, to meet climate goals. Innovative, ancillary technologies are needed to assist existing nuclear plants in operating more efficiently and help with the cost-effectiveness of advanced nuclear reactor designs.

### Waste-derived renewable fuels
Waste minimization and valorization play a critical role in a sustainable, net-zero economy, but full realization requires significant scale. Among valorization pathways, waste-to-renewable fuels has the greatest potential for scale and growth. Furthermore, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), waste-based renewable fuels are expected to see disproportionately high demand growth relative to other biofuels. While the opportunity is large, production processes for waste-derived renewable fuels are in early stages of development. Significant innovation and focused development are necessary to achieve full commercial scale and become competitive versus conventional biofuels and incumbent fossil-based fuels.  
Waste-to fuels pathways are those capable of converting waste and residue-based materials; such as cellulosic farm and forestry byproducts, organic landfill or municipal waste treatment plant solids, discarded plastics and recovered carbon dioxide; into direct-replacement hydrocarbon fuels, such as renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel (kerosene), and oxygenates including methanol, ethanol, butanol, and dimethyl ether.
