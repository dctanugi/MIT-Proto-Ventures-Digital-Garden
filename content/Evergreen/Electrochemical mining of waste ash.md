## Description of capability
[[Duhan Zhang]] and [[Yet-Ming Chiang]] are working on the recovery of metals from waste ash, e.g. incinerator waste.

## Key people
[[Duhan Zhang]] and [[Yet-Ming Chiang]] 

## Technology Readiness Level (1-9)


## Needs that this could potentially address
- "The proposed technology can upcycle major elements in fly and bottom ash, including calcium and silicon, to value-added products such as lime and silicates for use in construction applications."

## Tech specs
- >90% purity for each of Cu, Pb, Mg, and Ca, and with high recovery efficiencies >80% for all target elements including Zn and Si
- A first-order techno-economic analysis of the integrated process shows that the net revenue from the mining of a representative ash (~$120/tonne) is about twice the revenue from WTE electricity sales (~$55/tonne)

## Estimated time & cost to commercialize


## Outstanding risks
