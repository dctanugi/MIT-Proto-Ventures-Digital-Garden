Suggested by the nuclear & geothermal panel at the [[2023-04-10 MIT Energy Conference 2023]].

## Description of need
[[Nuclear fission]] companies are trying to extend the lifetime of existing plants. This requires regulatory and political approval.

To that end, nuclear companies are interested in proving to regulators that 80 years of irradiation is safe from a materials performance perspective.

## Problem severity (1-10)
7

## Who has this need
[[Nuclear fission]] industry

## Total addressable market (TAM)
Unknown

## Solutions today, and their shortcomings
- Material coupons

## Potentially relevant capabilities
- [[Cyclotron proton source]]
- [[Portable transient grating spectroscopy device]]
