## Problem statement
A research project at MIT shows significant promise but isn't ready for spinoff yet. Another ~$250K is needed to keep incubating the project and further de-risk the technology. No obvious source of funding is available today.

## Examples
- [[Ben Holtzman]]
- [[Theodore (Theo) Mouratidis]]
- [[Magnetohydrodynamic generators|MHD generators]]

## Potential solutions
[[Marco Ferrara]] understands the trickiness of having MIT spinoffs keep hanging around MIT and doing sponsored research there; he proposed a "**buffer layer**" entity that would license IP, pay for sponsored research at MIT, take a stake in spinoffs that it helps create and invest in. MIT could be an LP.

[[Nagarjuna Venna]] proposed raising a fund that pays for the requisite sponsored research and holds the IP licenses, and then spins off companies.
