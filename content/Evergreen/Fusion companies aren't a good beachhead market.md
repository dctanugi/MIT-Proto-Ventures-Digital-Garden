According to [[Bob Mumgaard]], the [[Nuclear fusion]] reactor companies won't be a meaningful market for several years. This is why the component companies are primarily selling to US national laboratories and government agencies like the [[UK Atomic Energy Authority]]. 

For ventures whose beachhead market is fusion reactor companies, [[Commonwealth Fusion Systems|CFS]] is happy to provide guidance and letters of intent to support the growth of this industry. The more they can outsource, the better. But [[Commonwealth Fusion Systems|CFS]]'s plan of record is to do almost everything themselves, because there is no guarantee that other service providers will be ready in time.
