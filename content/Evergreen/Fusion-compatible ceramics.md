## Description of need
Ceramics are present in many components in a [[Nuclear fusion]] reactor, and they will undergo heavy irradiation. D-T fusion generates neutrons and gamma rays, which create permanent and transient defects. Radiation increases electrical conductivity in ceramics, which is usually a bad thing. 

Ceramics will be "everywhere" in fusion plants:
- In RF cavity windows (e.g. Al2O3)
- Tiles for the plasma-facing components to prevent eddy currents 
- In the breeding blanket (for solid breeding blanket designs, e.g. Li₂O)
- HTS tape, e.g. [[REBCO superconducting material]]
- Neutral beam injector insulators
- Sensors and cameras (see [[Cameras that work in high-radiation environments]]
- Maintenance equipment
- Plasma-facing materials (e.g. SiC)
- Magnet coil insulators
- Electrical connections and cabling insulators (cable interconnects can't be plastic because of the high temperatures)
- Optical fibers (e.g. fused silica)
- Plasma spray insulation of structural components

The challenge is that ceramics become more conductive with damage, and they don't heal or anneal.
