[[ICF]] currently works with [[SunVerge]], [[Virtual Peaker]], [[OATI]], etc.

Should we be a direct aggregator (pilots for utilities), orchestrating DERs on behalf of utilities?

[The customer needs to be in the background. The grid should serve me, I shouldn't have to serve the grid.

[[Distributed System Operator]]  aka DER orchestrator. They want to be an overlay on top of all the aggregators underneath them.

If ICF sat side-by-side with a utility as a 'super-aggregator' for demand response. A middle entity that has a foot in each camp, ensures that the aggregators are operating with a minimum code of contact, and that the distribution grid is being taken care of too.

The super aggregator has SLAs with the aggregators. How does it help them?
- Help with customer acquisition
- Operate a secondary market for distribution grid objectives?
