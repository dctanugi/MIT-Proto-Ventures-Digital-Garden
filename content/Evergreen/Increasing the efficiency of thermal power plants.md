## Description of need
Only ~1/3 of the heat produced in thermal power plants is converted into electricity. Increasing the conversion efficiency of thermal power plants would drastically reduce the operating costs and amortized capital costs of thermal energy generation, including [[Nuclear fission]], [[Concentrated solar power]], and [[Coal power]].

## Problem severity (1-10)

## Who has this need
Power generation companies

## Total addressable market (TAM)

## Solutions today, and their shortcomings
