## Description of venture idea
A credit rating agencies like Moody's provide third-party assessments of financial institutions. A similar entity for the fusion industry would enable investors to better categorize and price fusion companies.

[[Andrew Lo]] was excited about the idea of a ratings and certification company for fusion that dictates for the entire field what are the relevant milestones (the equivalents of Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 for biotech companies), independently assesses fusion companies to determine whether they have passed a new phase, and generally establishes itself as the authority on 'quality' in the fusion sector. Maybe it verifies the DOE Milestone program achievements. [[Ally Yost]] confirmed that would be great.

## Market needs this venture would address
Third-party, objective, unbiased assessments of fusion investment opportunities for private & public markets

## Technical capabilities this venture might leverage
None

## Business model
TBD

## Team
[[Andrew Lo]]
[[Dennis Whyte]]

## Outstanding risks
- Is there enough of a market for this among private (not to mention public) investors?
- According to [[2023-11-30 Proto Ventures Channel Forum]] participants, it's too early for this venture: there is no fusion product to rate yet, it could be a potential drag on the ecosystem, and there is downside risk.
