## Description of need
Companies purchasing copper scrap (primarily semi-fabricators and smelters) need to ensure that the scrap they are purchasing is of high enough quality and does not contain too many impurities. This is difficult and expensive to do at scale.

## Problem severity (1-10)
7

## Who has this need
Copper semi-fabricators and smelters

## Total addressable market (TAM)
Copper semi-fabricators spend an average of $30K/mo on this today! Need to find out how many semi-fabricators are out there.

## Solutions today, and their shortcomings
Random sampling

## Potentially relevant capabilities
Proposed solution: a high-throughput system for inspecting copper scrap for copper content and contaminant content
