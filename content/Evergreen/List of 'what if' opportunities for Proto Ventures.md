*(starting with the ones that are most exciting to me):*
What if... 
- We could bypass the central power grid with more onsite generation and storage, and local power trading?
- We could replace the diesel generator? (this is similar to above)
- We could sell a cheap, fully local energy source that provides as much energy security as coal for China and India? (Geothermal seems like a good fit here)
- We could build a cost-effective, efficient heat pump or air conditioner that doesn't require HFCs?
- We could make it easier and cheaper to install a bidirectional EV charger?
- We could make real-time electricity pricing politically palatable by showing that a smart home can work around the price spikes?
- We could catch point-source industrial facilities that are exceeding their legal pollution limit? (Satellite imagery could help here...)
- We could tell households _why_ their power bill jumped?
- We could easily move transmission lines underground?
- We could prevent municipal water leaks?
- We could fine loud motorcycles?

Top areas to consider:
1. Beyond HFCs
2. Power customers take matters into their own hands: onsite generation; microgrids; reliability for critical loads
3. Minerals for a low-carbon economy: critical materials, battery recycling, mining, etc.
4. EV charging and [[Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X)]]
5. Adaptation
6. (Nuclear renaissance)
7. (Decarbonizing heavy industry: ammonia; industrial heat)
