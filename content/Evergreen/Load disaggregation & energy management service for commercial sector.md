## Description of venture idea
Companies like [[Sense]] provide real-time disaggregation & energy management to residential customers. Do we need something like this for the C&I sector? Disaggregation could easily recognize standardized appliances in convenience stores, restaurant chains, supermarkets, etc.

## Market needs this venture would address
- Reducing energy costs for industrial & commercial customers  
- Reducing aggregate energy demand for utility-funded [[Demand Side Management (DSM)]] programs

## Technical capabilities this venture might leverage
- Williams & Perakis (MIT)

## Business model


## Team


## Outstanding risks
- Competition: Potentially ESCOs (Energy Service Companies) - example: GridPoint, CPower, Innowatts, Quantitative Business Analytics (US), Dezem (Europe). Load disaggregation platforms, e.g. [SEW.ai](http://sew.ai/)
