## Description of need
[[David Fischer]] sees a commercial opportunity in a testing fixture for [[REBCO superconducting material]] tape companies to test the performance of their tape reels on a centimeter-by-centimeter basis in a high-magnetic-field, low temperature environment. Maybe a manufacturer that can offer pre-tested tape could command a price premium once the market for REBCO tape opens up.
Basically, the tape needs to be exposed to high magnetic field (5-10 T) under cryogenic temperatures (e.g. 20 K) and the electrical properties of each centimeter of tape needs to be characterized. 
## Problem severity (1-10)

## Who has this need
HTS tape manufacturers
## Total addressable market (TAM)
Unknown
## Solutions today, and their shortcomings
- Right now, HTS tape manufacturers rely on the customer (e.g. [[Commonwealth Fusion Systems|CFS]]) to carry out the testing.

However, according to [[David Fischer]], 77 K and low field is a bad predictor for low temperature (<20K) and high field applications. A machine that can measure the critical current under these (low T, high B) conditions along the length of a few hundred meter long HTS tape could be interesting.

## Potentially relevant capabilities
This could be a small-bore magnet (like the ones [[Dongkeun Park]] makes).
