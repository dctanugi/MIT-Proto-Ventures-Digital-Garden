According to [[Ken Hersh]],  we should be focusing our efforts on deploying existing technologies (see [[We should stop focusing on solutions for 2100 and instead work with the technologies we've got today]]) and to a lesser extent on leapfrog technologies that don't require decades of new infrastructure.

Hersh gave the analogy of [[Leapfrogging landlines with cell towers]] and suggested [[geo-engineering]] as an example.
