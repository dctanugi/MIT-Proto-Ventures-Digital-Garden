## Description of venture idea
Sell or lease [[Multiplexed auto-derived engine power modules]] for power production, either for the wholesale power market, local power distribution markets, or for individual facilities. 

## Market needs this venture would address
- [[Duck curve]] and the need for [[Long-duration energy storage]]
- [[Residential decarbonization in hard-to-electrify urban areas]]
- [[The transmission & distribution grid cannot handle all-electric winter heating]]
- Ammonia is the energy carrier of choice in a hydrogen economy, but there is no grid-scale solution for converting ammonia to electricity

## Technical capabilities this venture might leverage
[[Multiplexed auto-derived engine power modules]], maybe combined with an IoT platform to enable automated remote handling of an array of distributed modules

## Business model
- Build, Own, Operate

## Team
