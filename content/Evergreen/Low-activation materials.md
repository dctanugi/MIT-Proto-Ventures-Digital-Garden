**Neutron activation** is theÂ process in which neutron radiation induces radioactivity in materials, and occurs when atomic nuclei capture free neutrons, becoming heavier and entering excited states.

Fusion reactors will require so-called "low-activation materials" that aren't 
New alloys, called low activation materials have been developed to replace the standard stainless steels with Mn substituting for Ni. Martensitic Cr steels with W added for strengthening appear to have promise.

The primary low activation materials being developed by the international fusion materials community are: (1) [[Reduced Activation Ferritic-Martensitic (RAFM) steel]]s (2) vanadium alloys; (3) SiC/SiC composites; and (4) [[Oxide-dispersion-strengthened alloys]].

The [[ARPA-e]] GAMOW program has funded several projects in this area.
