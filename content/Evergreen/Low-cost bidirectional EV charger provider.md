## Description of venture idea
Ford's electric F-150 can power your home, but the bidirectional charger will cost you nearly $20k including installation. The promise of [[Electric vehicles|EVs]] as a grid stabilization asset will only be realized if bidirectional chargers become easier and cheaper to adopt.

This startup develops and delivers low-cost [[bi-directional EV chargers]] that don't require a complicated electrical upgrade.
