# Areas of expertise
The PSFC has deep expertise in:
* Plasma science
* Cryogenics
- Magnets (see [[High-temperature superconducting magnets]], or [[Magnetohydrodynamic generators|MHD generators]])
- High-power radio waves (see [[Ion cyclotron range of frequencies (ICRF) heating]] and [[Gyrotron]], as well as backward wave oscillators)
- Particle accelerators (e.g. [[Cyclotron proton source]]) and detectors
- Nuclear materials (e.g. [[Understanding materials degradation in a nuclear fission reactor]])

# Past or present applications
## Fusion energy
- [[SPARC tokamak]]
## Accelerators & detectors
## Plasma science
- Microwave-based sensors for soot detection, diesel vehicle filters, and environmental monitoring
- Improved sensors for the detection of explosives and chemical warfare agents
- Microwave torch plasma for continuous emissions that monitor stack exhaust pollution
- Millimeter-wave diagnostics for glass melters, including nuclear waste vitrification
- Plasma arc melters to convert waste into inert materials and organic waste into clean fuel
- Plasma-based chemical reactors for fuel reformation to reduce NOx emissions and improve fuel efficiency
- High power millimeter-wave sources to geothermal energy (see [[Quaise Energy]])
- [[High power millimeter-wave sources deep borehole storage of nuclear waste]]
