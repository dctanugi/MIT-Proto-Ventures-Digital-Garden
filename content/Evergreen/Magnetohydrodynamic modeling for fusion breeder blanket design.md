## Description of need
Fusion companies and research labs are struggling to design a liquid breeder blanket that simultaneously transfers heat and avoids magnetohydrodynamic craziness. This is especially true for liquid lithium, which would need to move very quickly (~ 1 m/s), and which is electrically conductive.

[[Tokamak Energy]] has expressed a need for better modeling capabilities in order to understand and mitigate the magnetohydrodynamic problems associated with liquid Li movement.

## Problem severity (1-10)
Unknown

## Who has this need
- Fusion companies pursuing liquid [[Breeder blanket]] designs like [[Tokamak Energy]] (liquid Li blanket).

## Total addressable market (TAM)
Unknown

## Solutions today, and their shortcomings
Unknown

## Potentially relevant capabilities
MHD work by [[Jeffrey P Freidberg]] and others?
