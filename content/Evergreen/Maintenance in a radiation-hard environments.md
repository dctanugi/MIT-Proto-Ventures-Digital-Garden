## Description of need
According to Venu Varma at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]], the neutron irradiation in a [[Nuclear fusion]] reactor can be as high as 1E5 Sv/hr and 1E5 W/m3 heat.

A comparison with [[Nuclear fission]] is helpful:
- In a PWR, all the fuel elements are inside water, so water does a good amount of shielding. You can go to do maintenance inside the reactor.
- In fusion, we don't have this luxury. Will need to do remote maintenance, i.e. remove and store large, highly radioactive components.

Utility connections are also a challenge, especially:
- the vacuum vessel seal
- the coolant seal
- the blanket seal
