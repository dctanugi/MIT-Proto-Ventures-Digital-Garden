## Description of need
During the [[2023 Fusion Fuel Cycle & Blanket Roadmap Workshop]], the [[Nuclear fusion]] community made it very clear that we lack crucial data about the properties and behavior of materials in a fusion environment. 

There is also a lack of thermo-physical data for tritium, which makes it hard to design systems without a full understanding of how tritium will interact with it.

## Problem severity (1-10)
7

## Who has this need
[[Nuclear fusion]] community

## Total addressable market (TAM)

## Solutions today, and their shortcomings

## Potentially relevant capabilities
[[Fusion Prototypic Neutron Source]]
[[Cyclotron proton source]]
[[How to release a materials database]]
