## Opportunities for innovation in microgrids:
- Modular microgrids with plug & play components and much less custom design & engineering
- [[James Kirtley]] sees an opportunity for using sensors to let microgrids determine in real-time *when to enter Island Mode* due to instabilities or faults on the main grid Jim almost started a company doing similar for the transmission grid. ([[2024-01-31 James Kirtley (microgrids)|link]])
- He also sees an opportunity for *better load management*, and for *electronic control systems for induction motors* that help them stabilize a microgrid
- The supply chain for *switchgear* equipment is a major hurdle today.
- According to [[Francisco Morocz]], major challenges today include:
	- Overall microgrid *robustness to individual equipment failures*. This is primarily driven by the instability and poor quality of inverters for batteries and solar, which really werenâ€™t built for 24/7 operation
	- the need to frequently *calibrate the battery management system* to get accurate SoC information
- Francisco sees opportunities to better integrate:
	- External data (power prices, weather, etc)
	- Heat
	- Load management (typically via APIs as opposed to modbus)
- The lack of standardization is a major challenge, especially for [[DC microgrids]]
- [[Renata Bakousseva]] recommended speaking to [Medhi Ganji](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mehdiganji/) at PG&E


## Learnings to date
- Microgrids:
	- Are good for resiliency of critical infrastructure
	- Enable the participation in Demand Response
	- Allow for greater integration of intermittent resources
	- Diesel backups are seldom operated, but purchasing them and maintaining them is a hassle
	- Are a good place to deploy new technologies in power supply, distribution, and demand (easier than deploying with utilities)
	- High cost is a challenge
	- Could be the answer to address long transmission interconnection queues, by enabling a site to meet the majority of its own electricity need (the enabling factor is really onsite generation and onsite batteries)
	- [[Superconducting magnetic energy storage systems|SMES]] could help improve short-term stability with voltage and frequency support
	- Multi-microgrids are a promising idea, but the US regulatory environment makes it hard today
	- Microgrid opportunities include:
		- Knowing when to enter Island Mode
		- Better load management
		- Electronic controls for induction motors
		- External data feeds
	- Utility interconnection is a challenge for new microgrid projects
	- Microgrids don't yet integrate well with (i) heat (ii) load management (especially server loads)
	- Microgrids are not very robust to individual equipment failures
	- Designing, permitting, and building a microgrid is really complex, custom, and time-intensive
	- ðŸ’¡ Design software and marketplace for new microgrid customers
	- The stability challenge of switching a microgrid to Island Mode is mostly solved
	- ðŸ’¡ Microgrid controls that integrate nontraditional loads like EV charging and IT server load
	- ðŸ’¡ Self-healing microgrids that are somehow robust to individual equipment failures


Note: Myles Kelly (myleskelly@mitre.org) at [[MITRE]] does interesting work at the intersection of data centers and microgrids. In his opinion, the limiting factor isn't so much in operating a gigawatt-class microgrid but rather in building this huge onsite power generation.
