## Description of need
This software should be flexible, modular, and work on modern computer architectures. It should also be expandable.

According to [[Theresa Wilks]], I would be appalled by some of the code that plasma scientists run. You need apprenticeship to learn how to use these codes.
## Problem severity (1-10)
6
## Who has this need
[[Nuclear fusion]] industry
## Total addressable market (TAM)

## Solutions today, and their shortcomings
-  [OMFIT](https://omfit.io/) is an open-source, integrated modeling framework developed by an ex-MIT person (Orso Meneghini) at [[General Atomics]]. He is working closely with [[ITER]]. You can deploy simulations locally or on remote servers. It is mostly a Python wrapper on the old codes.
