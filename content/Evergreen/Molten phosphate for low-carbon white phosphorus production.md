## Description of capability
[[Yogesh (Yogi) Surendranath]]'s group is working on a molten phosphate process for low-carbon [[White phosphorus]] production.

White phosphorus is essential for lots of products including Li-ion batteries (especially LiPO), glyphosates, etc. 

This technology is patented! Yogi spoke with [[Bayer]] about this, but they don't have internal development operations to license a technology like this and build it up. 

## Key people
[[Yogesh (Yogi) Surendranath]]

## Technology Readiness Level (1-9)
2

## Needs that this could potentially address
[[Low-carbon white phosphorus]]. In particular, this
>could allow industrial users to generate white phosphorus on site instead of having it shipped from the few places in the world where it is currently manufactured. That would cut down on the risks of transporting white phosphorus, which is an explosive material.

## Tech specs
Could cut the CO2 intensity of converting phosphate to white phosphorus by 50%

## Estimated time & cost to commercialize
Unknown

## Outstanding risks
Unknown
