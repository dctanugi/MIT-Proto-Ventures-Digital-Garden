## Description of need

Auto recyclers typically prioritize recovering metals from end-of-life vehicles, while plastic components and sub-components are often treated as waste and discarded. With increasing volumes of plastic in modern vehicles, there is a growing need for technologies and processes that enable recyclers to efficiently identify, extract, and monetize these plastic materials, enhancing overall recycling profitability and sustainability.

## Problem severity (1-10)

7 â€“ While not as critical as metal recovery, plastic waste from ELVs contributes to significant landfill volumes and represents a lost revenue opportunity. Additionally, regulatory pressures, such as the EU ELV Directive, and growing demand for recycled plastics amplify the importance of addressing this issue.

## Who has this need

- Auto recyclers and dismantlers
- Automotive OEMs aiming to increase recycled content in vehicles
- Plastic compounders and manufacturers seeking high-quality recycled resins
- Policy makers and regulators promoting circular economy initiatives
- Sustainability-conscious consumers and advocacy groups

## Total addressable market (TAM)

The TAM is estimated to be in the range of $3-5 billion annually, based on:

- The global volume of plastics in end-of-life vehicles (~20-30% of total vehicle weight, ~7 million tons annually).
- Current market prices for recycled automotive-grade plastics ($500-1,500 per ton, depending on type and quality).
- Increasing demand for recycled polymers in the automotive and other industries.

## Solutions today, and their shortcomings

- **Landfilling or incineration**: Default option for most ELV plastics; environmentally harmful and wasteful.
- **Manual dismantling**: Effective for extracting some high-value components (e.g., bumpers), but labor-intensive and costly.
- **Mechanical recycling**: Processes mixed plastics but often produces low-quality, contaminated output.
- **Chemical recycling**: Emerging for depolymerizing plastics like PP and PET but faces cost, scalability, and purity challenges.
- **OEM take-back schemes**: Limited scope and adoption, often relying on third-party processing.

## Potentially relevant capabilities

- Automated dismantling technologies for selective removal of plastic components.
- Advanced sorting technologies for polymer identification (e.g., NIR, FTIR).
- Chemical recycling technologies tailored to automotive plastics (e.g., depolymerization, solvolysis).
- AI and robotics for efficient material identification and disassembly.
- Market insights and logistics platforms to connect recyclers with buyers of recovered plastics.
