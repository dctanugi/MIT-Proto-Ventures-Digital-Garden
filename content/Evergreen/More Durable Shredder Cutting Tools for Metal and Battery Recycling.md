## Description of need
Metal and battery recycling facilities rely on shredders to break down materials, but these tools experience significant wear and tear when processing hard metals and complex battery components. Current shredder cutting tools degrade quickly, leading to frequent replacements, increased operational downtime, and higher maintenance costs. There is a critical need for more durable cutting tools that can withstand the harsh conditions of metal and battery recycling to improve efficiency and reduce costs.

## Problem severity (1-10)
8

## Who has this need
- Metal recycling facilities and operators
- Battery recyclers processing end-of-life lithium-ion and other battery types
- Shredder manufacturers and recycling equipment suppliers
- Recycling and waste management companies
- Automotive and electronics manufacturers aiming to improve circularity through material recovery

## Total addressable market (TAM)
The global metal recycling market is projected to reach over $400 billion by 2025, and the battery recycling market is rapidly growing, expected to reach $20 billion by 2030. The demand for durable cutting tools is a subset of these markets, potentially reaching hundreds of millions annually due to the high costs associated with frequent tool replacement and maintenance.

## Solutions today, and their shortcomings
1. **Standard hardened steel cutting tools**: These tools offer reasonable durability but wear out quickly when shredding hard metals or abrasive battery materials, leading to high replacement costs.
2. **Carbide-tipped tools**: While more durable than standard steel, carbide-tipped tools still wear down under the high-impact conditions of battery recycling, especially with lithium-ion batteries.
3. **Ceramic and composite materials**: These materials are resistant to wear but can be brittle, making them prone to cracking or breaking under the stresses of high-speed shredding.
4. **Tool coatings**: Surface coatings, like tungsten carbide or diamond-like carbon, add durability but only provide limited additional life, especially when cutting through dense or abrasive materials.

## Potentially relevant capabilities
Unknown. Possibly:
- **Advanced material science**: Development of new alloys or composite materials that combine hardness and toughness, potentially involving high-entropy alloys or metal matrix composites.
- **Wear-resistant coatings**: Innovations in coating technology that create ultra-durable surfaces, capable of withstanding high-impact and high-friction conditions without chipping or flaking.
- **Self-sharpening cutting edges**: Tools that maintain a sharp cutting edge over time by utilizing layered materials or microstructural designs.
- **Additive manufacturing (3D printing)**: Custom manufacturing techniques that allow for the creation of complex, reinforced geometries to enhance durability and reduce stress concentration points in cutting tools.
