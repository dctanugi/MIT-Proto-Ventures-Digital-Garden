## Description of need
Automatic Transfer Switches (ATS) are becoming an important component for [[microgrids]] and other sites with backup and critical loads. These must be synchronous in order to avoid grid stability problems during islanding.

However, these are costly today, which hinders the development of microgrids and onsite power for critical loads. There may be an opportunity here.

## Problem severity (1-10)
5

## Who has this need
Sites with critical loads

## Total addressable market (TAM)


## Solutions today, and their shortcomings


## Potentially relevant capabilities
