up:: [[Microgrids]]
## Description of need
The copper cables that are used for DC power transmission in microgrids or data centers are lossy and expensive.

## Problem severity (1-10)
2

## Who has this need
- Companies that design, build, operate [[Data centers]], like [[Peter Feldman]]'s
-  Other microgrids, e.g. for the military, electric ships. 

## Total addressable market (TAM)
Unknown

## Solutions today, and their shortcomings
- Copper cabling:
	- Joule losses in the copper cable tray
	- Cost of copper
	- Installation is expensive, especially in urban buildings (e.g. data centers in Manhattan)
- Supernode (Irish company) makes superconducting DC cables for offshore wind
- [[VEIR]] does both DC and AC cables

## Potentially relevant capabilities
- [[Superconducting cables for DC power distribution]]
- [[Superconducting magnetic energy storage systems|SMES]]
- [[Better fault current limiters for power grid]]
