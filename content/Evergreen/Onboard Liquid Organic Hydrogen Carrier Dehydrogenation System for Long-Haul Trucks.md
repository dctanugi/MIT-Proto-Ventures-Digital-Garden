## Description of capability
A concept for powering long-haul trucking with hydrogen based on fueling with liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) onboard hydrogen release.

- In the conventional approach, the efficiency from hydrogen production facility all the way to energy for truck propulsion is only 40%. With this approach, it's 87%.
- Their system is cost-effective (assuming infrastructure for LOHC production, delivery, and refueling) for hydrogen prices below $1.60/kg.
- The long term vision is for all heavy duty vehicles to be powered by this LOHC approach, with every gas station also offering LOHC refueling. In the medium term, only truck depot / warehouses would offer LOHC refueling, with sharing agreements among the different trucking companies. In the near term, only a single fleet would have LOHC refueling (and engines), with refueling stations at key warehouses (every 300 miles).
