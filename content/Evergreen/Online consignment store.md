## Description of venture idea
As a consumer or business, I want to get rid of a bunch of stuff that I no longer need. An Amazon-style truck comes and picks it all up, brings it to a centralized warehouse, automatically 3D scans everything, marks any defects, classifies it generates a title and description using computer vision and AI, and makes it available for others to purchase online. Proceeds are shared with the original seller to incentivize items in good condition and to avoid cross-contamination.
