## Structure and goals
From [[Lee Zamir]]:
> a weekly meeting that let everybody share any ideas, experiments, thoughts on what one could do that was fun and engaging with the group. I always prepared a bit of content to start each one off which is anything cool and interesting I learned in the past week about AR and its application to our world, But my main job that I gave myself in organizing that AR Roundtable was to make it fun and open to anyone in the company. I made people laugh and I celebrated everyone who shared their ideas openly - making it feel like a club and a fun thing to do every week.
> 
> Some other more specific things you can do beside creating that general environment mentioned above that I can suggest:
> 
>- Case studies - share out examples of successful translation of hard tech to industry
> Perhaps everyone in that audience knows this but my guess is most, if not all of them, have never started a company or venture
> Speakers - can you host entrepreneur guests related to their field for a ‘How I built this - style interview?
> Best Communications Practices
> I may be out on a limb here - but from the list in your email, my sense is that this group is highly technical and stays that way all too often. Perhaps an important skill for them to gain is how to talk and explain this stuff to non-technical people who they will need to bring on board in their entrepreneurial journey. How to explain it to less technical VC’s, government and policy people, their mom’s, etc…
> A technique could be to have people share the best examples of good communication about fusion and all its related technologies, problems, approaches, they have seen.
