## About
Dr. Paul Woskovâ€™s work involves development and use of technologies in the microwave through terahertz frequency range for applications in energy and environment. He has contributed to the development of the highest power millimeter-wave sources ([[Gyrotron]] and lasers) and highly sensitive millimeter-wave heterodyne receivers and the transmission technologies to exploit their use. His current work involves applying millimeter-wave technologies developed for magnetic confinement fusion energy research to enabling geothermal energy and deep borehole storage of nuclear waste.
## How we met
