## Notes
- [[Sam Wurzel]] doesn't like the term "picks and shovels". Fusion is very different from the gold rush. How about the Haliburton analogy? The oil industry is also different.
- In particular, [[It's challenging to build a technology company for the fusion industry]]. Luckily, there are some [[Strategies for technology companies serving the fusion industry]].
- [[Clea Kolster]] from [[Lowercarbon Capital]] warns that fusion companies have a wishlist, but there are enough alternatives today that none of the fusion companies have clearly committed to buy the 'pick' or 'shovel'). This means:
	- Getting financial commitments for purchasing is really desirable.
	- If that isn't possible, you must show that you can service other markets in the meantime.
