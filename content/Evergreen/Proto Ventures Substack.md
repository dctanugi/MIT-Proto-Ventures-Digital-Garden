## Topic idea list
- Introducing our project charter
- Are PSFC researchers interested in commercialization?
- [[Lessons learned from Cleantech 1.0]]
- This [thought-provoking article](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/03/climate-change-nuclear-power-safety-radioactive-waste/672776/) about the historical challenges of the nuclear fission industry in The Atlantic. It’s a reminder of the importance of designing smaller plants with fewer complex systems in order to avoid cost and schedule overruns, a lesson that will be essential for the fusion industry as well.
- Featured technology: MHD generators
- A taxonomy involving sea creatures
- Fusion and fission will compete for baseload power in the 21st century, aka "the economics of fusion". In conversations with past and present Tech-to-Market Advisors for fusion at ARPA-e, and with researchers at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, we’re learning about [potential early markets for fusion](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10894-021-00306-4) and [how fusion’s place on the grid will depend largely on its economics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542435123000752) — relative to nuclear fission in particular. An upcoming Fusion Study hosted by the MIT Energy Initiative (with participation from Dennis, Theo, and others at PSFC) will add to the discussion later this year.
- Don't underestimate tritium in the public acceptance of fusion. Japan is trying to discharge tritiated water from its Fukushima fission plants into the ocean, and the public uproar about it is [loud](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/07/21/tritium-impact-health-fukushima/). This is a reminder that fusion companies will need to take tritium extremely seriously in order to stay on the right side of public opinion.
