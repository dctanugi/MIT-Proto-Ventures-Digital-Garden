## Description of capability
A process that can produce elastomers and oils that are relatively resistant to radiation and tritium exposure.

## Key people
[[George Larsen]]

## Technology Readiness Level (1-9)
3

## Needs that this could potentially address
Applications in Space. Fission. Fusion. Accelerators.
For example in fusion, these polymers could be used for pump valves and sealants.

## Tech specs
Took samples up to 1 MGy and observed no change in mechanical / elastic properties, FTIR, or DSC.

## Estimated time & cost to commercialize
$25M to start producing commercial samples

## Outstanding risks
