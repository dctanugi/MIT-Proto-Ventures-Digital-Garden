## Description of need
In the current era of significant supply chain disruptions in the existing electric transformer industry, there is a critical market need for readily available transformers.

According to [UtilityDive](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/distribution-transformer-shortage-appa-casten/639059/):
>Only a few domestic manufacturers of distribution system transformers operate, and reasons for the delays and shortages include constraints on labor, materials and production capacity.

## Problem severity (1-10)
8

## Who has this need
Utilities
Storage projects (e.g. [[Form Energy]])

## Total addressable market (TAM)
Large

## Solutions today, and their shortcomings
- [[Ionate Energy]] (https://www.ionate.energy/) is commercializing a Hybrid Intelligent Transformer
- GE and [[Hitachi]] are also commercializing advanced transformers.
- [Amperesand](https://amperesand.io/) is commercializing solid state silicon carbide transformers.

## Potentially relevant capabilities
[[Superconducting power transformers]]
