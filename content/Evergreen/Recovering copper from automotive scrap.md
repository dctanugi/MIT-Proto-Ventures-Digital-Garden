## **Description of need**

Copper is a critical material in automotive manufacturing, used in electrical systems, wiring, motors, and batteries. As electric vehicles (EVs) increase in market share, the volume of automotive scrap containing valuable copper will rise significantly. Currently, much of this copper is either lost during recycling or recovered inefficiently. There is a growing need for efficient, scalable methods to recover copper from automotive scrap, particularly as demand for copper continues to rise due to electrification and green energy trends.

## **Problem severity (1-10)**

8  
This is a high-priority issue given the increasing demand for copper in EVs, renewable energy systems, and electrical infrastructure, coupled with supply constraints and geopolitical risks in copper mining.

## **Who has this need**

- Automotive manufacturers (particularly those producing electric vehicles)
- Metal recyclers and material recovery facilities (MRFs)
- Governments looking to secure critical material supplies for green energy transitions
- Copper suppliers and manufacturers
- Investors and stakeholders in the circular economy and critical materials recovery

## **Total addressable market (TAM)**

The global copper market is expected to exceed $300 billion by 2030, driven by demand from renewable energy systems, electric vehicles, and electrical infrastructure. The TAM for copper recovery from automotive scrap alone is a significant subset, estimated to be worth several billion dollars annually as electric vehicles become more prevalent.

## **Solutions today, and their shortcomings**

- **Current solutions**: Manual dismantling, mechanical shredding, and smelting are commonly used to recover copper from automotive scrap. These processes are labor-intensive, inefficient, and result in considerable material loss, especially for smaller components.
- **Shortcomings**: Current methods struggle to effectively separate copper from mixed materials such as plastics, aluminum, and steel in scrap vehicles. Additionally, smelting is energy-intensive and can generate harmful emissions. Advanced sorting and refining technologies are needed to improve recovery rates and reduce environmental impact.

## **Potentially relevant capabilities**

- Advanced separation technologies (e.g., electrostatic, hydrometallurgical, or pyrometallurgical processes)
- AI-driven sorting and automation for scrap material processing
- Electrochemical processes for selective copper recovery
- Efficient disassembly techniques for end-of-life electric vehicles
- Innovations in recycling technologies that target copper-rich materials while minimizing energy use and environmental impact
