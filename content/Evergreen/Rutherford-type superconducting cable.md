## Description of capability
[[Makoto Takayasu]] has invented and patented a design for making cables out of [[REBCO superconducting material]]. This approach is fundamentally different from the twisted-stack cabling method (based on a 2009 patent), aka "TSTC", that [[Commonwealth Fusion Systems|CFS]] has licensed from MIT.
## Key people

## Technology Readiness Level (1-9)

## Needs that this could potentially address
Most industries that would benefit from superconducting material:
- [[MRI]] manufacturers
- [[Nuclear fusion]] companies
- [[Electric Transmission]] companies like [[VEIR]]
- Maglev trains, space launchers
- etc.
This could take the form of a [[Superconducting Cable Company]].
## Tech specs
| | TSTC | Rutherford-type | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mechanical | - | Resistant to transverse load | 
| Bending | Difficult to bend in any direction | Easy to bend in one direction | 
| Cross section | - | Smaller cross-section for a given current | 
| AC losses | - | Lower | 
| Current distribution | - | More uniform | 
| Design flexibility | Only one place for cooling channel | Flexible location for cooling channel | 

## Estimated time & cost to commercialize
2 years and $500k to make a machine and start producing cables

## Outstanding risks
- "Cooling in conduit" has not yet been demonstrated
- Cost per meter is unknown
- Ease of roll-to-roll production is still unproven
