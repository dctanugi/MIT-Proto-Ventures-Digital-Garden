## Description of capability
Kerri Cahoy et al. are developing a set of analytical techniques that can detect power line anomalies, vegetation overgrowth that could result in forest fires, and other geospatial information related to monitoring power lines for greater reliability and forest fire prevention.

## Key people
[[Kerri Cahoy]]

## Technology Readiness Level (1-9)
2

## Needs that this could potentially address
[[Preventing and mitigating wildfires]]

## Tech specs
TBD

## Estimated time & cost to commercialize


## Outstanding risks
There is an inherent tension between time resolution (want high resolution) and spatial resolution (want fine resolution).
