## Description of need
In industries such as [[Nuclear fusion]], commercial entities are building complex cooperation agreements with third parties, including universities, other commercial entities, national laboratories, etc.

This process is long (slowing down the progress of the company), expensive (in lawyers fees), and complex (taking up bandwidth from the leadership team).

Thus, there is a need for a solution that would streamline or accelerate the process of building cooperation agreements with partner entities.
