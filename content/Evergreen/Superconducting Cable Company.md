## Description of venture idea
This venture produces and sells superconducting cables made from [[REBCO superconducting material]], most likely [[Rutherford-type superconducting cable]].
## Market needs this venture would address
- [[Nuclear fusion]] companies
- Companies developing [[MRI]] or [[Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)]] machines
- Companies developing superconducting [[Electric Transmission]] lines (e.g. [[VEIR]]) 
## Technical capabilities this venture might leverage

## Business model
Sell superconducting cable by the meter.

## Team
[[Makoto Takayasu]]

## Outstanding risks
- Will be dependent on [[REBCO superconducting material]] manufacturers
- Is the market big enough?
- [[Commonwealth Fusion Systems|CFS]] IP vs MIT IP
- According to [[Zach Hartwig]], there isn't a great market for cables today. There are a few mom & pop shops like [[Advanced Conductor Technologies]] in Colorado. The market is small, the tape is expensive.
- According to [[2023-11-30 Proto Ventures Channel Forum]] participants, this service/product exists. Eg [[Commonwealth Fusion Systems|CFS]] is making cables and magnets. There are many HTS suppliers as well. This is a robust, competitive growing market, well protected by IP and existing products.
