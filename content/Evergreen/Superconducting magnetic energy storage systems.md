## Description of capability
Superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) systems store energy in the magnetic field created by the flow of direct current in a superconducting coil which has been cryogenically cooled to a temperature below its superconducting critical temperature. This relies on [[High-temperature superconducting magnets]].

SMES lose out on cost and energy density relative to batteries. Where they compete is on very high power discharges and the ability to do many thousands of cycles. Promising applications include frequency regulation and uninterruptible power supplies (on the millisecond-second time frame).

Major challenges include AC losses.

## Technology Readiness Level (1-9)
Unknown. Probably pretty high given that commercial devices appear to exist already.

## Needs that this could potentially address
- [[Power quality issues on a grid with heavy renewables penetration]]
- Enhancing performance of Flexible AC transmission system (FACTS) devices (see [source](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118991978.hces210))

## Tech specs
- Round-trip efficiency is greater than 95%
## Estimated time & cost to commercialize
Unknown
## Outstanding risks
AC losses
