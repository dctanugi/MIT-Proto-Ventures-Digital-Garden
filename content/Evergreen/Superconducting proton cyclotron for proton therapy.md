## Description of capability
[[Joseph V Minervini]], [[John Brisson]], et al. are proposing the development of superconducting proton cyclotron for proton radiotherapy. Joe and team came up with another design (also MIT IP) that is "ironless". It doesn't require an iron pole; instead use superconducting coils for shaping the field distribution and shielding the field like it's done in MRI systems.  This lets you  change the current in the magnet, so you can tune the proton energy. That means you get a cleaner beam, and you can preserve the whole beam intensity (e.g. 90 nA). This could enable 'flash therapy'.

## Tech specs

## Estimated time & cost to commercialize
- Joe and team want to build the superconducting system + cryogenics, somebody else like IBA or [[Sumitomo Corporation]] would build the beam line and the rest of the system.
- They envision a joint venture (called RTD), funded primarily by a Taiwanese corporation called H2, with [[Novum Industria LLC]] and another Tennessee-based company ProNova as co-developers of the first few prototypes in exchange for ownership in the joint venture. The [[John Brisson]] Group would also do sponsored research, funded by RTD. Leslie could use help thinking through
