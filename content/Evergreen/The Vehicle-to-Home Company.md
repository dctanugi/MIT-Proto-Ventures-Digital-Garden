## Description of venture idea
This startup is premised on the idea that [[Vehicle-to-Home (V2H)]] will inevitably become as prevalent among EV-owning homeowners as solar (and as easy to obtain), and that we'll become the company that does it.  This includes providing and delivering the directional charging equipment, circuit protection equipment, and handling all the utility permitting (including potentially a tool for utilities to handle these interconnection requests faster).
