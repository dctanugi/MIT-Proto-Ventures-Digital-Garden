## Description of venture idea
[[Kerri Cahoy]] and Mary Dahl are developing capabilities to monitor power line risks that could result in forest fires. These risks include:
- Vegetation dangerously close
- Broken power lines
- "Other" (e.g. the bracket holding the line broke)

The underlying idea is to measure harmonics from power lines in the radio signal from satellites. 

## Market needs this venture would address
[[Preventing and mitigating wildfires]]

## Technical capabilities this venture might leverage
[[Satellite-based power line monitoring]]

## Business model
TBD

## Team
Mary Dahl and [[Kerri Cahoy]]

## Outstanding risks
Can we design a mission that can predict wildfire risk from power lines?
	- Could we piggyback off existing satellites? Only if they have the right antennas..
	- Orbit design:
		- Lower orbits means shorter satellite lifetimes (e.g. 1-2 years) but more frequent flyovers per day. There is a tradeoff here.
	- If you need a response within minutes, you need COVERAGE! 
	- If you want fast response, the best option is probably using Planet Labs optical data
