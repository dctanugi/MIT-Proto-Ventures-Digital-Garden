## Description of capability
This cryocooler concept utilizes sound waves to produce refrigeration at extremely low temperatures. By harnessing the principles of thermo-acoustics, this device has the potential to improve the field of cryogenics, leading to more efficient and environmentally friendly cooling solutions according to [[John Brisson]] and his group.

Basic principle: generate a high amplitude acoustic wave in a resonance tube. That generates coolth.  

- [[Jacob Adams]] has developed a new type of cooler that uses acoustic waves driven by reeds to do mechanical work. 
- They could fill a niche in mid-scale applications that are too small for turbo-expander based systems.
- He has demonstrated a proof of concept with a single stage. The prototype performance isn't inherently superior to other cooler types, but it demonstrates the concept.
- The acoustic generator generates acoustic work from a continuous flow. A puff of gas goes into the inlet reed, a puff of lower-pressure gas leaves through the outlet reed. The acoustic wave is dissipated into heat in the ambient medium through a dissipator (basically a metal screen).
- Could enable simple, mid-scale cryocooler systems.

## Needs that this could potentially address
- Natural gas extraction from capped wells:
	- Many natural gas wells in the US are capped, because the estimated reserves are too small to justify setting up a pipeline. One of these cryocoolers could liquefy this natural gas, powered by the heat of burning some of the natural gas. A company tried to do this, but it doesn't scale well to large scales.
- Hydrogen boil-off mitigation in a liquid hydrogen tanker truck for [[More economical hydrogen transportation]]. The tube would be ~10m in length.
