up:: [[Transactive Energy]]

## Description of venture idea
The venture aims to develop an innovative [[Transactive Energy]] platform that facilitates decentralized and efficient energy transactions. Leveraging advanced technologies, the platform seeks to optimize energy distribution, enhance grid resilience, and empower prosumers in participating in the evolving energy landscape.

The grid is becoming more distributed and variable, creating opportunities for more decentralized energy transactions. Transactive energy is mature in the academic literature, but no serious startup is tackling the opportunity to be the solution provider for transactive energy hardware and software.

## Market needs this venture would address
1. **Decentralized Energy Management:** Addressing the increasing demand for decentralized energy systems by providing a platform for efficient management and trading of locally generated energy.
2. **Grid Optimization:** Meeting the need for more resilient and optimized energy grids capable of handling a diverse range of energy sources.
3. **Prosumer Empowerment:** Enabling prosumers to actively participate in energy markets, promoting sustainability and reducing dependence on traditional utility models.

## Technical capabilities this venture might leverage
1. **[[Blockchain]] and Smart Contracts:** Utilizing blockchain technology for secure, transparent, and automated energy transactions.
2. **Decentralized Control Algorithms:** Implementing advanced algorithms for real-time energy management and optimization.
3. **[[Internet of Things]] (IoT) Integration:** Leveraging IoT devices for monitoring, control, and communication within the energy network.
4. **Data Analytics:** Employing data analytics for insights into energy consumption patterns, market trends, and grid performance.
5. Ilic Group and Annaswamy Group at MIT

## Business model
TBD

## Team
None.

## Outstanding risks
The future of transactive energy is still unknown. Headwinds for [[Transactive Energy]]:
	- Surface-to-volume ratio. As you scale down, a lot of the sensing, etc.
	- Commodity value. Electricity is just a cheap commodity compared to oil, data, etc. Too cheap to anything interesting with it. That explains why it's been hard to make progress with microgrids.
	- Simplicity is ultimately king.
