## Description of need
Fusion reactors (e.g. reactors based on deuterium-tritium) involve lots of neutron radiation. This will potentially create lots of material degradation, so it is essential to understand these degradation mechanisms in order to develop neutron radiation-resistant materials and to understand how to monitor and predict inevitable degradation of materials in a fusion reactor.

Materials for which the community needs better irradiation understanding include:
- Ceramic breeder materials
- Multiplier materials (e.g. Be or Be oxide)
- Structural materials (e.g. low-activation materials)

Regulatory bodies may _require_ proton irradiation testing for fusion plants if they become convinced that such testing is relevant.

## Solutions today, and their shortcomings
1. Materials irradiation in nuclear reactors. Downsides:
	- Low material damage rates
	- High cost at rare facilities
	- Long and few learning cycles
	- Low fidelity for most fusion materials
2. Low energy proton / self-ion beams. Downsides:
	- Damages surface layers not bulk materials
	- Inability to extrapolate to bulk properties
	- Low fidelity for most fusion materials
3. IFMIF DONES facility. Downsides:
	- First material data in early 2040s at the earliest.
