## Description of need

[[Automotive shredder residue]] (fluff) is the non-metallic byproduct of auto shredding operations, consisting of plastics, foams, textiles, glass, and residual metals. It is typically landfilled or incinerated, contributing to waste management challenges and environmental concerns. There is a need for technologies that can economically recover valuable materials from ASR, reduce landfill reliance, and improve the sustainability of shredder operations.

## Problem severity (1-10)

8 â€“ ASR represents a significant waste stream in shredder operations and a lost opportunity for material recovery, particularly for residual metals. Landfilling incurs high costs, environmental liabilities, and increasingly strict regulations, which drive the urgency for sustainable solutions.

## Who has this need

- Automotive shredder operators
- Recycling companies processing end-of-life vehicles
- Industries reliant on secondary metals
- Environmental regulators
- Local governments concerned with landfill usage and emissions

## Total addressable market (TAM)

The TAM is estimated in the range of $4-6 billion annually, based on:

- Global production of automotive shredder residue (~10 million tons per year)
- Costs of landfilling/incineration (~$100-150 per ton)
- Potential value of recovered materials (e.g., residual metals, polymers).

## Solutions today, and their shortcomings

- **Landfilling**: Common but unsustainable; rising costs, environmental regulations, and public pressure make it less viable.
- **Incineration**: Converts ASR to energy but releases pollutants and misses opportunities for material recovery.
- **Mechanical sorting technologies**: Can recover some residual metals but struggle with the complexity and heterogeneity of ASR.
- **Chemical recycling**: Emerging approaches for plastics in ASR, but scalability, cost, and purity challenges remain.
- **Pyrolysis/gasification**: Promising for energy and some material recovery, yet expensive and limited by technical and regulatory barriers.

## Potentially relevant capabilities

- Advanced sensor-based sorting systems (e.g., LIBS, XRT, NIR)
- Chemical separation or dissolution technologies for mixed polymers
- Hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical processes for recovering residual metals
- AI-driven material characterization and process optimization
- Modular processing units for decentralized ASR treatment
- Partnerships with secondary materials markets (e.g., metals, plastics)
