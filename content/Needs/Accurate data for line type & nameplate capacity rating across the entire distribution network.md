## Description of need
Planning engineers at distribution utilities want accurate, trustworthy data for the ampacity ratings of all the lines on their network. Right now, rating numbers are available, but they aren't always accurate. As the power system starts pushing power lines to their limit, it'll become increasingly problematic to get it wrong.

The goal, then, is to map out the ampacity rating (in kVa) of all the power lines on the network. 

This is a classification exercise. There are roughly a dozen possibilities for conductor type. If it's an uncoated conductor, the diameter and metal type is all you need. If it's coated, it's a bit more complex but not much more.

The utility's GIS system has a map of all the lines, but it doesn't know where individual line segments end (sometimes a tree falls, ruptures a line, and a lineman in splices a new section of line with a different ampacity rating).
