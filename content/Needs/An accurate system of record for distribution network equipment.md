## Description of need
A major pain point for distribution planning engineers like [[Benjamin Grace]] is having to constantly scrub the models, because data from the GIS platform (GE SmallWorld) is wrong or gets extracted incorrectly before being inserted into Eaton CYME.

In other words, [[Domenico Fuda]]'s idea of a "one-stop shop software for utility planners that acts as the system of record for all network assets" sounds nice (Ben has essentially built this for himself in CYME), but it probably wouldn't make sense for it to be a standalone new piece of software.

## Problem severity (1-10)
7

## Who has this need
Distribution planning engineers (Field Engineers)

## Total addressable market (TAM)
S/M

## Solutions today, and their shortcomings
A lot of manual work. 

## Potentially relevant capabilities
Unknown

## Other notes
- [[Benjamin Grace]] at National Grid agrees that this is lacking. Basically, Ben has built this for himself inside of CYME. Includes the queue management, which is his own approach. 
- Risk: maybe this is a module in CYME? Hard to imagine a brand new software in addition to all the existing tools.
- [[Michelle Pittman]] implied that National Grid might build this in-house (see [[2024-07-01 David Smith and team (National Grid)]])
