## Description of need
Domestic e-waste recyclers often can't afford e-waste feedstock because they get outbid by recyclers in foreign countries (e.g. Malaysia) where component recovery is manual and informal. They need technologies that enable them to extract more economic value from e-waste feedstock, primarily by recovering (and classifying) electronic components more effectively.

As the volume of e-waste continues to grow globally, there is an urgent need for efficient, scalable methods to recover valuable electronic components from discarded devices. Current e-waste recycling processes largely rely on manual disassembly or shredding, which can be labor-intensive, costly, and result in the loss of high-value components like semiconductors, circuit boards, and capacitors. Automated systems for component recovery could increase recovery rates, reduce processing costs, and improve material circularity.

## Problem severity (1-10)
8

## Who has this need
- US-based e-waste recycling facilities and processors

## Total addressable market (TAM)
The e-waste recycling market is expected to exceed $60 billion by 2030, with a growing portion allocated to automated systems. As electronics continue to proliferate and governments implement stricter e-waste regulations, the demand for automated recovery solutions could represent several billion dollars of the e-waste management market.

## Solutions today, and their shortcomings
1. **Manual disassembly**: Labor-intensive and costly, limiting the economic feasibility of recovering small or complex components from e-waste.
2. **Shredding and sorting**: Common for large-scale e-waste processing but often destroys valuable components, leading to low material recovery rates for high-value parts like ICs and precious metals.
3. **Robotic disassembly**: Emerging technology, but still limited in scope; existing robotic systems struggle with the variability and complexity of different device types and require substantial investment.
4. **Pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical processes**: Effective for recovering metals, but these methods are resource-intensive, generate environmental pollutants, and are unsuitable for component-level recovery.

## Potentially relevant capabilities
- **Computer vision and AI**: Advanced computer vision algorithms to identify specific components within mixed e-waste streams, coupled with AI to enable adaptive disassembly processes.
- **Robotics and precision handling**: Robots with fine motor skills to extract components accurately, combined with adaptive grippers for handling various shapes and sizes of electronics.
- **Sensor technology**: Use of spectrometers or X-ray technology to identify valuable materials and verify component quality, ensuring only viable parts are recovered.
- **Automated sorting systems**: Conveyor and sorting systems tailored for electronics, capable of separating components with minimal human intervention and integrating seamlessly into recycling facilities.
- **Machine learning for device recognition**: Algorithms that learn to recognize a wide range of electronic devices and components, enabling efficient sorting and disassembly across diverse e-waste types.
