## Description of need
As a utility (e.g. SCE), I can't possibly build all the network that will be needed fast enough." If I don't succeed, the region won't meet its decarbonization objectives and SCE will be blamed for it. Political backlash. Reduction in ROE. And I'll be failing to take advantage of revenue growth. 

## Problem severity (1-10)
8

## Who has this need
Power utilities in the US

## Total addressable market (TAM)


## Solutions today, and their shortcomings


## Potentially relevant capabilities
SCE has a whole proposed plan for how to reduce the amount of grid buildout required (see screenshots below):
1. Changes in design (e.g. going to higher distribution voltages on existing right of ways, solid-state transformers, providing DC service)
2. Changes in operations (e.g. DLR)
3. Changes in planning (less siloed planning to avoid redundancy and inefficiencies in what's built)
