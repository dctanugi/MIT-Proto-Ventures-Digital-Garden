## Description of need
Critical loads in urban areas (e.g. hospitals) need regulatory approval for their backup power sources, with stringent requirements for particulate emissions. This makes it difficult and expensive to build adequate backup for these critical loads.

[[Data centers]] do care about this to an extent:
>Displacing the diesel fuels that typically power data centre back-up generators is another challenge. Amazon plans to switch to biofuel made from waste oils for its back-up generators at all its data centres in Europe, starting with sites in Ireland and Sweden.
