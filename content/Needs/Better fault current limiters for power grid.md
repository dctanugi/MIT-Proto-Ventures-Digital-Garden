## Description of need
HTS materials like [[REBCO superconducting material|REBCO]] can be employed in fault current limiters (FCLs) to protect electrical grids from short-circuit faults. FCLs based on HTS technology could rapidly and automatically limit the flow of excessive current during faults, preventing equipment damage and minimizing power disruptions. By maintaining grid stability and preventing cascading failures, HTS-based FCLs enhance the reliability and resilience of the electrical power infrastructure.

## Notes
[[Dongkeun Park]] worked on superconducting fault current limiters for his PhD thesis. He writes:
>The major concerns for the resistive type HTS FCLs to be used for power grids are high voltage, especially HV in a cryogenic structure (medium voltage like <22.9 kV would be much easier) and its required recovery time. Also, it requires a close collaboration with FCL users who can provide a detailed design required specification, and can provide a fault testing facility.
