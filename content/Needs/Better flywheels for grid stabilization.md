## Description of need
Flywheels could play a role in stabilizing the grid under high renewables penetration, especially wind (see Bachovchin thesis, 2015). But current flywheel systems are not "good enough".

## Problem severity (1-10)
5

## Who has this need
- Wind plant operators
- Utilities

## Total addressable market (TAM)
Unknown

## Solutions today, and their shortcomings
- Early-stage startup: [Qnetic](https://www.qnetic.energy/product)

## Potentially relevant capabilities
- [[REBCO superconducting material]]
- [[Automated variable speed drive for flywheels]]
- [[Passive magnetic bearing design for flywheels]]

## Notes
[[Francis O'Sullivan]] feels that better flywheels would be a big deal! We are losing physical inertia on the grid. You would probably sell into ancillary services and the capacity market for ancillary services. 

According to [[Dongkeun Park]], you need multiple [[High-temperature superconducting magnets|HTS magnets]] to support a flywheel. But the cost of cooling is very high!

Shockingly (to me), flywheels don't rotate synchronously with the grid frequency! See [this reference](https://www.stornetic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/a-WhitePaper-Benefits-of-FlyWheels-for-Short-term-Grid-Stabilisation.pdf). 

Flywheels are sometimes used in conjunction with synchronous condensers for frequency regulation (see [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)]]): https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy20osti/75848.pdf

[[Beacon Power Corporation]] was an MIT spinoff and tried to commercialize flywheels.
