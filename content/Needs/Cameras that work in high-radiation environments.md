## Description of need
In high-radiation environments such as monitoring and maintenance in [[Nuclear fusion]] reactors, standard cameras can't withstand the expected radiation doses according to Venu Varma at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]]. The fusion industry needs cameras that work in high-radiation environments for monitoring and maintenance activities inside the reactor.

## Problem severity (1-10)

## Who has this need

## Total addressable market (TAM)

## Solutions today, and their shortcomings
- Tube cameras are relatively and large. Image resolution is low.
- CCD cameras: Low radiation tolerance.
- CID cameras: Possibly best. Maybe not enough for fusion reactor environments, though.

## Potentially relevant capabilities
- [[Mike Short]] is proposing new classes of radiation-hard ceramics that would help with this challenge. See [[2023-07-19 Mike Short]]
