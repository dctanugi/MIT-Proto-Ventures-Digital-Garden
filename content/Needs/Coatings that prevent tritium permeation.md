## Description of need
Tritium permeation barriers (TPBs) effectively inhibit the permeation of [tritium](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/tritium "Learn more about tritium from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") fuel in structural materials and improve the tritium self-sustaining capacity of fusion reactors.
## Problem severity (1-10)
3
According to [[Sara Ferry]], the fusion field may circumvent the need for tritium permeation barriers.
