## Description of need
This is a significant need for the geothermal industry, and arguably for other advanced drilling applications.

## Problem severity (1-10)
7

## Who has this need
According to the [[2023-11-30 Proto Ventures Channel Forum]], high-temp electronics would be in "an instant hit" with:
- The deep [[Geothermal energy]] industry. 
- Fusion industry
- Aerospace industry, where it's hard to radiate heat.

## Total addressable market (TAM)


## Solutions today, and their shortcomings


## Potentially relevant capabilities
Palacios Lab (MIT)
