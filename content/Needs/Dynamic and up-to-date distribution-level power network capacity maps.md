## Description of need
There is a need for utilities to provide more dynamic and up-to-date distribution-level **capacity maps** to help developers propose projects in the right places.

Some utilities already host capacity maps to show publicly on a local level, where the most congested feeders are. This can help developers target areas that won't require additional upgrades. But these maps are only updated annually, so there is a **need for more dynamic distribution-level capacity maps**.
