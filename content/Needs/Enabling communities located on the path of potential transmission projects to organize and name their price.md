## Solutions today, and their shortcomings
### Current Solutions:
1. **Public Hearings:** Typically organized by project developers, these often lack transparency and may not adequately capture community concerns.
2. **Community Meetings:** Informal gatherings may occur, but without structured processes, communities might struggle to present unified positions.

### Shortcomings:
1. **Limited Organization:** Communities often lack tools to organize and collectively express their preferences.
2. **Information Asymmetry:** Communities may not be fully informed about the potential impacts and fair compensation standards.
3. **Lack of Negotiation Power:** Without a structured approach, communities may find it challenging to negotiate fair compensation.

## Potentially relevant capabilities
