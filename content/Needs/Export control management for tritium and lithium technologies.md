## Description of need
According to [[Mohamad Abdallah]] at [[Tokamak Energy]], there is a need for services or technologies that streamline the export control process for tritium and lithium technologies. Right now, obtaining tritium or lithium-related technologies is a big hurdle.

It's not the safety side that gets in the way, actually. Setting up a lab that handles tritium for R&D purposes isn't all that hard. What's hard is the _export control_ of the technologies and documentation associated with handling tritium. Tritium technology is [dual-use technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-use_technology) so you have to interact at the international level to work with any suppliers or collaborators. For example, if Mohamad needs a glovebox for handling tritium, and he wants to work with a US-based glovebox manufacturer, then merely receiving the documentation from the US-based manufacturer requires export control approval! A lengthy and complicated process. Note: Lithium-related work is subject to similar export controls since lithium is also a dual-use technology.
