## Description of need
Fusion companies need better candidate materials for functional components. The process of designing and developing these candidate materials is too slow today, which is a major issue for fusion timelines.

## Problem severity (1-10)
6

## Who has this need
Fusion companies

## Total addressable market (TAM)
$1B?

## Solutions today, and their shortcomings
The traditional approach to nuclear materials is too slow. This is a "cook and look" method with a 5-7 year cycle time.

## Potentially relevant capabilities
[[Rapid Automated Materials - Design, Downselect, Deploy (RAM-3D)]]
