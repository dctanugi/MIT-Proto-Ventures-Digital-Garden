## Description of need
In many [[Nuclear fusion]] plant designs, the vacuum vessel will have to be replaced on a regular basis (every few years). It will be heavily activated and will contain tritium.

Fusion plants will require the removal, de-tritiation, processing, and disposal of their vacuum vessels.

## Problem severity (1-10)
5
## Who has this need
[[Nuclear fusion]] companies

## Total addressable market (TAM)

## Solutions today, and their shortcomings
Companies like [[Holtec]] specialize in dry cask storage for [[Nuclear fission]] used fuel assemblies. They may be looking into solutions for fusion. Need to investigate.
