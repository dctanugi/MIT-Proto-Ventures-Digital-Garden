## Description of need
Low-loss transmission lines are essential for efficient power grid operation due to the significant distances over which electricity must be transported from power generation sources to end-users. As electrical energy travels through transmission lines, resistance in the conductors generates heat, resulting in energy losses. High-loss transmission lines would lead to increased energy dissipation, reducing the overall efficiency of the power grid. To minimize these losses and ensure the reliable delivery of electricity, low-loss transmission lines are crucial. By using materials with low electrical resistance and optimizing the design of transmission infrastructure, the power industry aims to enhance the efficiency of energy transmission, decrease environmental impact, and improve the overall performance of the power grid. This becomes especially pertinent as the demand for electricity continues to grow, emphasizing the importance of investing in technologies that promote energy conservation and grid reliability.

## Problem severity (1-10)
8

## Who has this need
Utilities and transmission system operators

## Total addressable market (TAM)
XL

## Solutions today, and their shortcomings
Startups working on this:
- [[VEIR]]
- [[TS Conductor]]

Note: [[Zach Hartwig]] cautions that there are already companies commercializing superconducting transmission lines and so forth. But the challenge is that [[REBCO superconducting material]] is very expensive, quantity limited, and there is not a lot of expertise in it. Fusion is unique because power density scales with $B^4$, so fusion companies can afford to pay a very high premium for REBCO.

## Potentially relevant capabilities
