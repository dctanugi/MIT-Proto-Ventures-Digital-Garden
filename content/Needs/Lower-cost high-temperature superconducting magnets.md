## Description of need
Viable large-scale economic use of [[High-temperature superconducting magnets]] for [[Nuclear fusion]] requires a magnet cost below $50/kAm. At present it's 4x that. So the industry needs [[Lower-cost high-temperature superconducting magnets]].

## Problem severity (1-10)
2
The odds that a new market entrant can compete with the HTS tape manufacturers and/or with the leading HTS magnet provider ([[Commonwealth Fusion Systems]]) are very low according to [[Sara Ferry]].

## Who has this need
* MRI manufacturers
* Gyrotron manufacturers
* Fusion device companies: Tokamaks, Stellarators, linear fusion concepts

## Total addressable market (TAM)

## Solutions today, and their shortcomings
- The leader in HTS tape today is a Japanese company
- Startups like [[MetOx]] and [[AMPeers]] are shooting for order of magnitude improvements in the cost of making superconducting tape.

## Potentially relevant capabilities
