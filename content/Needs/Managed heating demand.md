## Description of need

Faced with increasing heating electrification and the advent of winter demand peaks, power distribution utilities need to manage heating demand efficiently to ensure stable and reliable supply while optimizing energy usage and minimizing costs.

## Problem severity (1-10)
8

## Who has this need

Power distribution utilities, grid operators, energy management companies, and industries relying on continuous power supply. Inefficient management of heating demand can lead to power outages, increased energy costs, and strain on the grid, especially during peak demand periods or extreme weather conditions.

## Total addressable market (TAM)
Unknown
## Solutions today, and their shortcomings
Thermostat-based demand response for residential central heating. Doesn't work for split systems. Cannot store heat. Doesn't allow the heating system to operate at partial power.

## Potentially relevant capabilities
1. Advanced data analytics for real-time monitoring and predictive modeling.
2. Smart grid technologies enabling demand response mechanisms.
3. Integration with IoT devices for remote monitoring and control.
4. Machine learning algorithms for dynamic load forecasting and optimization.
5. Energy storage solutions to mitigate peak demand spikes.
6. Automated control systems for rapid response to changing demand patterns.
7. [[Grid-connected building heating with thermal storage]]
