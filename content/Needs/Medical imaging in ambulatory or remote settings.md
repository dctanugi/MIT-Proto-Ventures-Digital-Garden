## Description of need
[[MRI]] machines are used to diagnose a wide variety of medical conditions by creating images of internal organs, tissues, and bones that can help doctors identify abnormalities or diseases. For example, MRI scans can be used to diagnose problems with the brain and nervous system, as well as conditions affecting the heart, liver, and other organs.

Currently, they are large and bulky and can only be found inside hospitals, so they are unavailable in ambulatory settings (e.g. ambulances) or remote settings (e.g. small towns).
