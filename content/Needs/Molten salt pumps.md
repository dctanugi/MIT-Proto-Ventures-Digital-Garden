## Description of need
According to [[Ally Yost]] of [[Commonwealth Fusion Systems]], [[Nuclear fusion]] that use molten salts (like [[Commonwealth Fusion Systems]]) need molten salt pumps. These pumps sit outside the blanket and moves molten salt around the primary loop.

Requirements according to [[Davin Young]] at [[Commonwealth Fusion Systems]](see [[2023-08-31 Davin Young (CFS)]]):
- Cannot melt in hot [[FLiBe]] (~480 ºC after heat exchanger or ~630 ºC before)
- Cannot corrode in hot FLiBe: minimum 2 years between maintenance
- Must survive the neutrons, tritium, daughter nuclides, etc.
- 1-2 m3/s flowrate
- 2-20 bar in outlet pressure (10-100 m of head)

## Problem severity (1-10)
5

## Who has this need
- Fusion companies that use molten salts such as [[FLiBe]]
- Perhaps fission companies that use [[FLiBe]] (e.g. [[Kairos Power]])?
- Perhaps [[Concentrated solar power]] companies that use molten salts?

## Total addressable market (TAM)
Unknown

## Solutions today, and their shortcomings
[[Hayward Tyler]] is the leading manufacturer of canned motor pumps. But existing canned motor pumps are not compatible with FLiBe.

## Potentially relevant capabilities
