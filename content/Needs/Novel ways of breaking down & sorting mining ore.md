## Description of need
A more effective or energy-efficient way to break down ore (for Al, Cu, Zn, Fe...) or separate valuable minerals would reduce costs and increase environmental sustainability for mining companies.

## Problem severity (1-10)
8

## Who has this need
Mining companies

## Total addressable market (TAM)
TBD

## Solutions today, and their shortcomings
Crushing and grinding ore: energy-intensive (and energy is hard to come by on mining sites)

## Potentially relevant capabilities
- High power RF technology (e.g. [[Gyrotrons]])
- Magnetic separation using [[High-temperature superconducting magnets|HTS magnets]] ([[Dongkeun Park]] at MIT PSFC)
- [[Nuclear Resonance Fluorescence]]
