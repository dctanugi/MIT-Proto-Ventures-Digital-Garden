## Description of need
Fusion requires a plasma-facing material that can withstand fusion conditions.
## Problem severity (1-10)
6
## Who has this need
Fusion companies
## Total addressable market (TAM)

## Solutions today, and their shortcomings
- Tungsten won't work because it cracks too easily.
- People are contemplating a "tungsten-heavy alloy", i.e. ductile nickel-iron mortar with nano bricks of pure tungsten. But the material is 1% nickel overall, which is too high activation. 

## Potentially relevant capabilities
- Mike envisions develop a better tungsten-heavy alloy whose mortar doesn't have nickel.ductile nickel-iron mortar with nano bricks of pure tungsten.
