## Description of need
For a utility like [[National Grid]], the different Customer Groups (EVs, distributed generation, etc.) have their own work request queues, but there is no central project queue at National Grid. Instead, they all submit their study requests to the planning team. Engineers like [[Benjamin Grace]] maintain their own internal project "queue" that is basically the order of layers in the project management panel of their CYME instance. 

A more consistent and automatic approach to queue management and project assumptions for a given study is needed.

## Problem severity (1-10)
6

## Who has this need
Distribution utility planning groups and customer groups

## Total addressable market (TAM)
S/M

## Solutions today, and their shortcomings
Manual systems

## Potentially relevant capabilities
A more systematic queue management system with a more consistent methodology for determining what to include in the analysis (e.g. which proposed projects to treat as already built).
