## Description of need
According to [[Mohamad Abdallah]], it's very difficult to find new employees with fusion-related design experience and/or operational experience of a fusion reactor. People who've been a chief engineer of a fusion reactor before, who have an understanding of the design, building, commissioning, and operating. This manifests as poor decision-making or lack of appreciation for tritium-related systems, plasma-facing component design, etc.
