One major source of methane leaks is from coal mines ([source](https://climatechangenews.com/2023/11/09/china-sets-out-methane-plan-but-no-reduction-target/?utm_medium=email&_hsmi=282640124&utm_content=282640124&utm_source=hs_email)):
>This gas is explosive and dangerous so mine operators suck it from underground mines up to the surface where it damages the earth’s atmosphere, causing climate change. But, coal mine methane analyst Anatoli Smirnov told Climate Home, the “only real solution to reduce methane emissions is to close coal mines”. They then must be flooded or sealed, with a pump installed to capture the gas that still leaks and use it for something productive. [But] the Chinese government lacks the “political will and buy-in” to [actually] start controlling methane. Since late 2021, he said, China’s priority has been to increase the amount of coal China produces to get the coal price down.
