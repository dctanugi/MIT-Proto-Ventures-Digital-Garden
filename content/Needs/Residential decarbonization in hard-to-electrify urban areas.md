## Description of need
According to [[Badar Khan]], electrifying existing buildings in dense urban areas is exceedingly difficult because of the highly disruptive construction (road closures, etc.) required. If we can't electrify all of Manhattan or downtown Boston, how will these dense urban areas become decarbonized? There is no good solution today.
