## Description of need
As the volume of small-format batteries from electronics and power tools increases, recyclers face a major challenge in effectively sorting lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries from nickel-cadmium (NiCd) batteries. NiCd batteries can contaminate batches of Li-ion batteries, with cadmium (Cd) contamination severely diminishing the economic value and recyclability of Li-ion battery materials. 

To ensure high recovery yields and economic viability, small-format battery recyclers and sorting companies need advanced sorting technologies that can accurately and non-invasively separate NiCd from Li-ion batteries without destructive testing or labor-intensive sorting.

## Problem severity (1-10)
8

## Who has this need
- Battery recyclers
- Battery sorting and collection companies processing large volumes of mixed battery types

## Total addressable market (TAM)
The global battery recycling market, projected to exceed $20 billion by 2030, includes a significant market for sorting technologies. With the increasing regulatory and economic pressures for clean battery recovery, a robust NiCd-Li-ion sorting solution could address hundreds of millions in annual market demand among recyclers, sorting facilities, and battery collection services.

## Solutions today, and their shortcomings
1. **Manual sorting**: While feasible for low volumes, manual sorting is time-consuming, error-prone, and increasingly impractical as battery volumes rise.
2. **X-ray fluorescence (XRF)**: XRF can detect cadmium, but it is often slow, expensive, and may struggle with battery casings that obscure material identification.
3. **Assay testing**: Requires cutting and sampling the battery contents, which is labor-intensive, costly, and results in destroyed materials.
4. **Electrochemical or visual sorting methods**: Limited in accuracy and tend to be unreliable due to variability in battery size, shape, and labeling, especially for small-format batteries.

## Potentially relevant capabilities
Uknown. Possibly:
- **Non-destructive elemental analysis**: Real-time scanning technologies, like enhanced XRF or laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), capable of detecting cadmium presence through the battery casing.
- **Advanced AI and machine learning**: Algorithms trained on battery characteristics (size, shape, weight, color, etc.) to automate identification and improve sorting accuracy.
- **Electromagnetic or density-based sorting**: Techniques leveraging subtle differences in material properties between NiCd and Li-ion batteries to separate them without opening.
- **Imaging and computer vision**: High-resolution imaging combined with machine learning to detect subtle differences in appearance between NiCd and Li-ion batteries in a fast, automated process.
- **Automated sorting machinery**: Development of modular sorting units that integrate identification technology and automated separation, capable of handling high volumes with minimal intervention.
