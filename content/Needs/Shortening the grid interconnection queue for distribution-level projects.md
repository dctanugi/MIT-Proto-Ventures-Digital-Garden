## Description of need
US utilities have gigawatts of project requests in the queue, both on the demand and on the generation side.

At [[National Grid]], the longest step in the process is if the project application trigger a transmission study. This would go to ISO's study queue. National Grid performs it, but it is only performed when it reaches its spot in the ISO New England queue.There are a lot of megawatts that will be stuck behind the ISO transmission studies. (Note: the reason this takes time is not necessarily the study itself, but the fact that you need to wait for ISO NE: “the time is right”. )
