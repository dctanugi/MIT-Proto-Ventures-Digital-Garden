## Description of need
The queue for new interconnections on the US transmission grid is many months long. New energy projects are desperate for utilities to adopt solutions that would speed up this process. 

## Problem severity (1-10)
9

## Who has this need
- Renewables project developers
- Energy storage projects
- New loads (e.g. data centers)
- Utilities

## Total addressable market (TAM)

## Solutions today, and their shortcomings
- [[Pearl Street Technologies]] is tackling some of the technical steps involved in the interconnection process

## Potentially relevant capabilities
- [[Technical study software for grid operators conducting interconnection assessments]]

## References & notes
- [[Francis O'Sullivan]] had suggested providing the entities charged with the interconnection queue with tools to streamline their feasibility assessments. The assessment process is very complex, in part because it is dynamic: some proposed projects in the queue might come online, which would change everything for other projects in the queue. However, Frank cautioned that this is a problem that is very difficult to get into because you can probably can't easily get paid.
- How might we get renewablesÂ developers (or data centers) to pay for some of the grid buildout, and have them hopefully adopt grid technologies faster than grid operators and utilities might? [[Francis O'Sullivan]] believes this probably not possible today; it would require legal or regulatory changes. Right now, all the grid buildout and associated planning needs to be done by the grid operators themselves.  (note: [[Scott Burger]] from Form Energy might disagree).
- [[Phil Giudice]] is not bullish on venture opportunities on this topic, except perhaps with the exception of data centers (see [[2024-01-16 Phil Giudice on grid expansion opportunities]]).
