## Description of need
In 3D printing or many powder metallurgy applications, you start with a powder. There is considerable interest in developing new powder alloys, which requires small batches. Right now, atomizers (ultrasonic or gas-based) are large, expensive, and produce large batches.

## Problem severity (1-10)
5

## Who has this need
Metal alloy powder companies

## Total addressable market (TAM)
Unknown

## Solutions today, and their shortcomings
- Ultrasonic atomizers ($250K at least)
- Gas atomizers (even more expensive)

## Potentially relevant capabilities
[[Desktop-sized ultrasonic atomizer]]
