## Description of need
In the [[2023 Fusion Fuel Cycle & Blanket Roadmap Workshop]], the [[Nuclear fusion]] community was unanimous about the need for more facilities that can handle tritium, for example to test the performance of tritium permeation barriers, or [[Durable tritium-compatible vacuum pumps]], or for [[Understanding materials degradation in a deuterium-tritium fusion environment]].

## Problem severity (1-10)
8 - the fusion industry can't really move forward without these

## Who has this need
[[Nuclear fusion]] industry

## Total addressable market (TAM)

## Solutions today, and their shortcomings
- Colin from [[Kyoto Fusioneering]] and I talked about the UNITY facilities, and the pros and cons of deuterium testing as a proxy for tritium testing.  Colin's perspective is that deuterium is a good proxy for tritium for materials / components testing, but definitely not for isotope separation. Also, atomic substitution and decay effects can't be accurately captured with deuterium.
- [ ] Existing companies like [[Torion Plasma Corporation]]
- [[Remi Delaporte-Mathurin]] is proposing the building of a new tritium facility at PSFC
