 Opportunities that [[Hannah Friedman]] at [[Planeteer Capital]] is mostly bullish on:
	- **Buildings**: Models that make buildings more resilient, e.g. a platform that is the system of record for building resilience data and that makes it easier for building owners to ensure they are doing all the resilience upgrades that they need
	- FEMA stuff: Disaster prevention and management. Helping cities run simulations and plan how populations will move and get away during a disaster. [[The Climate Disaster Planning Company]]. Helping cities with people management after a disaster. etc. 

The first PE fund dedicated to adaptation and resilience: see [deck](https://lightsmithgp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/asap-adaptation-solutions-taxonomy_july-28-2020_final.pdf), run by Jay Koh.
