## To Do
- [ ] See [[2024-03-14 Richard Pearson]]
- [ ] Flesh out these opportunities:
	- [ ] (Ally) Which opportunities are fusion concept specific, and which ones are applicable to a broad range of fusion concepts?
	- [ ] (Michael Segal): Make a [[2023-12-11 Michael Segal|histogram]] of the number of commercial efforts announced in the various categories of the supply chain.
	- [ ] (Ally) Put these on a time axis. How does the need for each of these things evolve over time? Maybe show the roadmap of the fusion industry and on what time frame these various opportunities become relevant, needed, and chokepoints.
	- [ ] (Dennis) Estimate TAM for these opportunities (e.g. maybe it's normalized per MW of generation capacity or MWh of energy)
	- [ ] Will any other markets also need this before fusion is ready?
	- [ ] Regroup these in a more business-oriented way, (e.g. the LSVV opportunity may be actually about vanadium components for a variety of industries)
	- [ ] Allude to the potential role of large incumbent corporations for some of these (e.g. as partners)
- [ ] Reach out to US Fusion Energy and [[Fusion Industry Association]] and possibly the [Fusion Investment Programme](https://www.neimagazine.com/news/newsukaea-awards-contracts-to-boost-uk-fusion-industry-10644705) at UK AEA
- [x] Re-read [[Challenges to achieving economical fusion energy]]
- [x] Flesh out the list below
- [x] Talk to Stefano and/or Samuele about pumps, fuel cycle, etc.

## Summary

# Miscellaneous notes
## Industry needs
### [[Commonwealth Fusion Systems]]
According to [[Bob Mumgaard]], the big areas that [[Commonwealth Fusion Systems|CFS]] isn't actively focusing on and where they'd love somebody else to offer goods & services:
	- Tritium fuel cycle
	- Balance of plant
	- Power supply
	- Heat exchangers
	- Materials development, testing, and selection

According to [[Ally Yost]], top needs at [[Commonwealth Fusion Systems|CFS]] include:
- Pumps:
	- "Tritium pumps"
	- [[Molten salt pumps]]
	- [[Direct Internal Recycling]] pumps
- Novel alloys, especially [[Metal alloys that can perform at cryogenic temperatures]]
- Vanadium alloys
- Remote welding (for [[ARC tokamak]])
- [[Compact, low-cost cryogenic systems for fusion plants]]. Working with giants like [[Air Liquide]] is not easy.
- [[Heat exchangers that operate at high temperatures without melting or corrosion]] / [[SiC-SiC composite heat exchangers for very high temperature cycles]]
- [[Methods for joining refractory materials to structural materials]] (maybe this is the same as "Monolithic joining of refractory plasma facing materials to structural materials")
- High power transistor chips for [[Plasma heating solutions that can deliver tens of megawatts at high duty cycle for several years]]

What isn't clear from this FIA report is: what is the challenge with each of these areas? 

## Industry shape (see [[Commercial fusion opportunity map]])
How [[Bob Mumgaard]] pictures the fusion industry shaping up:
	- "Full stack" companies like [[Commonwealth Fusion Systems|CFS]] will act as architecture-specific integrators. They will sell to the same entities that buy power plants today, i.e. energy companies. These reactor companies will also handle the development and construction. Analogies: [[Boeing]], [[First Solar]], [[BrightSource Energy]]
	- The reactor companies will buy components and services from third-party providers. This will include:
		- Engineering software. For example, [[Commonwealth Fusion Systems|CFS]] purchases neutronics simulation software from [[Silver Fir Software]]. 
		- Test equipment (e.g. test rigs for [[High-temperature superconducting magnets]])
		- Radiation testing of materials and components ("Will this survive 20 years in a fusion reactor?")
		- etc.
	- Industries to look at for inspiration:
		- The aerospace industry. The airplane industry is also structured as a two-tier system, with a small number of major manufacturers at the top and a large number of smaller suppliers at the bottom. The major manufacturers, such as [[Boeing]] and [[Airbus]], design and build the airplanes, while the suppliers, such as GE Aviation and Pratt & Whitney, provide the engines, avionics, and other components.
		- The drilling rig industry. The major manufacturers, such as [[National Oilwell Varco]] (NOV) and [[Halliburton]], design and build the drilling rigs. Meanwhile, the service providers, such as [[Weatherford International]] and [[Schlumberger]], provide the drilling fluids, mud pumps, and other equipment and services needed to operate the rigs.
		- Note: the [[Nuclear fission]] industry is a bit different in the sense that integrators like [[Areva]] and [[Westinghouse]] don't do project development.

According to [[Sam Wurzel]] at [[ARPA-e]], fusion industry provider companies can be categorized into:
- [[fuel cycle]] and [[Fusion breeding blanket|breeder blanket]]s
- Durable goods ([[REBCO superconducting material]] tapes, laser glass, electronics, [[Gyrotron]]s, cryogenics...)
- Software (integrated design tools, simulation tools...)
- Consumables (fuel isotopes, gasses, electrodes...)
- Services (recycling, waste disposal, maintenance and operations, training...)

[[Sam Wurzel]] and [[Malcom Handley]] point out that it's difficult to predict the future shape of the fusion industry because the fusion plant companies don't necessarily aim to operate like Boeing (i.e. just an integrator); many of them may aim to be more like [[SpaceX]] (i.e. completely vertically integrated). 

One approach might be to list the main parts of the value chain, for example:
- R&D
- Materials
- Components and software
- Integrators
- Financing, professional services
- EPC
- Operation
- Maintenance, safety, and decommissioning

We could also make a list of major unsolved needs for a [[A Fusion Pilot Plant (FPP) by 2035]], such as (in no particular order):
1. First wall materials that can withstand a fusion environment
2. A way of removing all the tritium from solid (e.g. structural materials) and liquid (e.g. water) waste prior to disposal
3. A way to finance fusion plants
4. Easier to use, more integrated, commercial-grade simulation and design software
5. Energy-efficient RF sources for plasma heating (concept dependent)
6. Vacuum pumps that can... (what's the problem with today's vacuum pumps exactly? Tritium compatibility?)
7. Coatings that prevent tritium diffusion out of the blanket
8. A way to perform perform maintenance in the heart of the system
9. A way to test performance and stability of materials in fusion-representative environments
10. Ways to selectively remove helium and other contaminants from the heart of the fusion system
11. Workforce training and recruiting
12. Ways to shield magnets from neutrons (concept dependent)
13. A way to continuously extract all the tritium from the blanket (concept dependent)
14. A way to prevent plasma disruptions and optimize plasma performance
15. Sensors that can withstand a fusion environment
16. And so forth...
For each of these unsolved needs, we could list a set of opportunities (e.g. need: maintenance; opportunity: robots), and the type of actor that seems best positioned to address this particular need (e.g. fusion plant companies, established industrial corporations, startups, nonprofit researchers).

### Who will develop, own, build, operate, and decommission fusion plants?
According to Tim Bestwick, the way things will work in the UK for the first pilot plant is that a special purpose company, UK Industrial Fusion Solutions Ltd, with the [[UK Atomic Energy Authority]] as the fusion partner, a construction partner, an engineering partner, and system partners (e.g. magnet providers).

- [[Mike Short]] says that [[MIT Plasma Science & Fusion Center|PSFC]] and [[Commonwealth Fusion Systems|CFS]] started a fusion workforce study, in partnership with [[Constellation Energy]] to figure out how many workers of what type are needed for a fission plant, an oil plant, and a gas plant, and then we'll map out what we think a fusion plant will need.

## Miscellaneous thoughts
[[Vladimir Bulovic]]: In the aviation industry, Boeing has lots of vendor choices, so that no individual vendor has that much power. Whereas here a single vendor could completely hold the fusion industry by the balls. What are the fundamental technologies that have the potential to do that?

[[Brad Smith]] said: What if we had an interactive microsite that lets you explore the different parts of a fusion plant and the technological / commercial opportunities in each?
