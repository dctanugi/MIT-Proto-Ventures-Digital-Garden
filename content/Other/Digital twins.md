>A digital twin is a set of virtual information constructs that mimics the structure, context, and behavior of a natural, engineered, or social system (or system-of-systems), is dynamically updated with data from its physical twin, has a predictive capability, and informs decisions that realize value. The bidirectional interaction between the virtual and the physical is central to the digital twin.

>The key elements that comprise a digital twin include (1) modeling and simulation to create a virtual representation of a physical counterpart, and (2) a bidirectional interaction between the virtual and the physical. This bidirectional interaction forms a feedback loop that comprises dynamic data-driven model updating (e.g., sensor fusion, inversion, data assimilation) and optimal decision-making (e.g., control, sensor steering).
