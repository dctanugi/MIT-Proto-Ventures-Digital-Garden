In [nuclear fusion power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion_power "Nuclear fusion power"), a **divertor** is a device within a [tokamak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokamak "Tokamak") or a [stellarator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellarator "Stellarator") that allows the online removal of waste material from the [plasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics) "Plasma (physics)") while the reactor is still operating. This allows control over the buildup of [[Nuclear fusion]] products in the fuel, and removes impurities in the plasma that have entered into it from the vessel lining.
