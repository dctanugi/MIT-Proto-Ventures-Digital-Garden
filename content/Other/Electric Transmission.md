In 2021 and 2022, Congress and federal executive agencies almost achieved three goals that could have transformed the grid:
1.   A tax credit for large-scale interregional transmission would have made new lines cheaper for consumers and eased the path to cost recovery and investment.
2.   A proposed FERC rule would have made transmission planning more proactive for long term reliability and to connect the future energy mix in each region.
3.   And a bill from West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin would have addressed cost allocation and streamlined the federal permitting process.

But as of now, none of those measures are in place.

Flexible Alternating Current Transmission System (FACTS) devices are used to enhance the transmission and control of alternating current (AC) electricity in the transmission grid.
