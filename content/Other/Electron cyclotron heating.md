## Description of capability
EC heating is the first auxiliary heating method in [[ITER]] reactor. It involves frequencies of ~100 GHz or more and leverages [[Gyrotron]] devices. The frequency required is 28 GHz per Tesla of magnetic field.

## Key people
- [[Miklos Porkolab]]
- [[Gregory Wallace]]

## Technology Readiness Level (1-9)
Unknown

## Needs that this could potentially address
Unknown

## Tech specs
$k_{//} \approx 15-18 m^{-1}$

## Estimated time & cost to commercialize
Unknown

## Outstanding risks
- ARPA-E identified two main challenges for RF technology for fusion:
	- Efficiency of [[Gyrotron]] and [[Klystron]] devices (currently only 30-40%)
	- Lifetimes. Right now, gyrotrons burn out after a few hours of total use.
