FLiBe is a molten salt that is a mixture of [lithium fluoride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_fluoride "Lithium fluoride") (LiF) and [beryllium fluoride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryllium_fluoride "Beryllium fluoride") (BeF2). 

Because it's a liquid, it can act as both a [[Fusion breeding blanket]] and a coolant for heat transfer inside a [[Nuclear fusion]] reactor.

FLiBe has a high boiling point, so it can absorb a lot of heat while remaining at atmospheric pressure.

Its low electrical conductivity will allow it to move easily despite the reactor's strong magnetic fields.

## Challenges
- [[Materials that can resist corrosion by FLiBe]]
- [[Recovering tritium from the fusion breeder blanket]]
