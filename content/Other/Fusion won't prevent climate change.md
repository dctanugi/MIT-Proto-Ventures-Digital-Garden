According to [[Matt Trevithick]], fusion simply won't be ready in time to mitigate climate change (and arguably, it may already be too late to prevent climate change anyway). In his view, [[Nuclear fusion]] will be useful in the second half of the 21st century for [[Climate adaptation]]. The implicit claim is that climate adaptation is energy-intensive (e.g. air conditioning, building storm walls, etc.).
