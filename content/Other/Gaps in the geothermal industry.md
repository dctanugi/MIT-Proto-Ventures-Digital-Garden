According to [[Carlos Araque]] of [[Quaise Energy]], the major whitespace in deep [[Geothermal energy]] sector are:
* [[Deep geothermal drilling technology provider]] (esp. cements, explosives, and drilling electronics that work at high temperatures)
* [[Seismic methods for measuring permeability and fluid mobility in the lithosphere]]
* [[Real-time monitoring technologies for drilling, stimulation and heat extraction in deep geothermal]]

Basically, this means replicating for geothermal everything that exists for oil & gas. Either by adapting what exists for oil & gas, or creating something totally new if necessary.
