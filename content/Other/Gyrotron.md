These are ~100 GHz generators of [[High-power radio-frequency technology|High-power RF]]. They rely on [[High-temperature superconducting magnets]]. The resonant frequency is the magnetic field x 28, so that 1 Tesla field leads to a 28 GHz RF source.

According to [[Jagadishwar (Jag) Sirigiri]] from [[Bridge 12]], commercial gyrotrons for fusion:
- Can generate 1 MW at 170 GHz with 50% efficiency
- Main failure mode is the lifetime of the collector (~10k shots)
- The main limitations come from cooling the cavity and collector, and thermal stresses
- Frequencies are limited by magnet cost. Can't go beyond 170 GHz with NbSn.

MIT technological capabilities related to gyrotrons include:
- [A Novel Wideband Gyrotron Traveling Wave Amplifier](https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/93220/02rr006_full.pdf;sequence=1)

There may be new applications to gyrotrons (see [[New commercial applications of gyrotrons (WIP)]]).

It may also be possible to develop a [[High-powered gyrotron for fusion]] thanks to advances in magnet technology. Related would be a [[Better gyrotron for geothermal drilling]].

## Major vendors
- [[Bridge 12]]
- [[Kyoto Fusioneering]]
- Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe
- Others...

## Challenges today
- Efficiency of gyrotrons and klystrons (currently only 30-40%)
- Lifetimes: Right now, gyrotrons burn out after a few hours of total use.
