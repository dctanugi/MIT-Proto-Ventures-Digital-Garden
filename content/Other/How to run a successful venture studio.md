Here’s how its 18-month model at Conduit Venture Labs works:
- The firm first generates and validates a number of ideas for potential companies by conducting market research, making customer calls, and creating prototypes.
- After projects are narrowed by validity, the studio recruits a team and leverages its network of consultants and mentors to help guide and develop the startup.
- Once the company is mature enough, it’s spun off as a standalone entity and raises seed capital.
