Klystrons generate and amplify electromagnetic waves in the microwave range.

### Applications today
Their primary commercial applications are in radar systems, particle accelerators, communication systems, and industrial heating.

### Potential future applications
Klystrons could be used for industrial heating processes like microwave drying, sterilization, and food processing

### Limitations
They are heavy, bulky, and only 40% efficient.

## Ongoing research
Efforts are being made to miniaturize klystron technology, incorporating solid-state components and advanced cooling techniques. A more efficient klystron would be more compact, lighter, and more energy-efficient.
