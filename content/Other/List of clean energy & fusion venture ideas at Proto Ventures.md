## Other Categorizations
One can also categorize these venture ideas by potential market size and likely venture type:
- Tadpoles: Promising and could become huge but need more R&D:
- Tunas: Improves an existing process. Good licensing opportunity:
- Orcas: Medium TAM (~$100M); Probably best fit for strategic VCs or a mega-fund.
- Moby Dicks: Large TAM ($1B+). Likely to capture a meaningful part of the value chain. Well poised to raise VC funding.
