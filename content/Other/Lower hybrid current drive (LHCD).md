## Description of capability
LHCD is a method of driving current in a plasma. It is an application of [[High-power radio-frequency technology|High-power RF]] for [[Nuclear fusion]]. A typical frequency is 5 GHz, and the source is usually [[Klystron]]s.

- [[Andrew Seltzman]] is on developing an LHCD current drive for the DIII-D tokamak. His main innovation is to put the "launchers" inside the hole of the tokamak donut, as opposed around the outside. 
- Andrew has done a lot of work on the manufacturing of LHCD components, particularly the launchers (which direct the RF waves and are hidden, in his design, behind the tungsten tiles in the scrape-off layer contacting the plasma). In particular:
	- The use of metal [[Additive manufacturing]] with high-strength alloys
	- Special metal alloys that don't contain any high-activation elements like Nb
	- Post-processing like welding and polishing for an optimal waveguide performance
