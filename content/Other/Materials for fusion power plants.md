## High-level materials requirements
According to an [[ARPA-e]] report, the requirements for materials in fusion power plants can be summarized as follows. Solid & self-healing materials with the following features:
- minimize half-lives of materials
- reduce dust formation
- minimize fuel retention (e.g., hydrogen)
- minimize the displacement per atom due to neutron irradiations
- high heat resistant (> 600 C)
- corrosion resistant

## Specifics
- [[Materials that can resist corrosion by FLiBe]]
- [[Low-activation materials]]
- [[Extending nuclear plant lifetimes]]
