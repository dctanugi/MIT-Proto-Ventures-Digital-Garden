- [[Dennis Whyte]]
- [[Mike Short]]
- [[Julianna Mullen]]
- Jenn Scarborough
- [[MIT Technology License Office|MIT TLO]]

## Assorted notes
[[Brad Smith]]'s feedback:
- PSFC grads only might be too narrow
- Co-host this event with [[RA Capital]], or the [[Deshpande Center]], or [[The Engine]], or [[Activate]]?
- Brad is picturing an invite-only event, with investors and other savvy folks as the primary audience.
- Maybe we invite [[Bob Mumgaard]] to talk about [[Commonwealth Fusion Systems|CFS]] five years in. 
- Talk to [[Deshpande Center]]. maybe use their event resources.
- This sounds a bit like the [[Proto Ventures hosted dinner]] event that Gene and I have talked about, so it's different than the charm offensive for curious PSFC grad students and postdocs that I had in mind.

Mike Short's idea is to have an event similar in format to the [[2023-11-30 Proto Ventures Channel Forum]] (see [[2023-12-05 Mike Short]]).
