## Idea
Articulate for PSFC a few stories of what tech spinouts can look like, common failures, success pathways, etc. Compare Ambri, Form Energy, CFS, etc.

You can have 1-2 big ideas and many small spinouts. A new gyrotron company that is 50% better than on the market is worth building, even if I don't want to do it myself. It'll be a valuable contribution to PSFC.
- Articulate different types of market opportunities:
	- High: $1B/yr. VCs.
	- Medium: $100M/yr. Pathway: SBIRs. 
	- Low: $10M/yr 
- Articulate the growth pathways of these different company types.
