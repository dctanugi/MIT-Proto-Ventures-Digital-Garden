A class of superconducting materials whose critical temperature is (relatively) high. They enable [[High-temperature superconducting magnets|HTS magnets]].

REBCO comes in the form of a flat tape. It then needs to be assembled into a cable with multiple layers of tape.

Startups like [[MetOx]] are shooting for order of magnitude improvements in the cost of making superconducting tape.
