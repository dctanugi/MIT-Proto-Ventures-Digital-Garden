Aka "Simplest Possible [[ARC tokamak]]"

SPARC is a [[Nuclear fusion]] device being designed jointly by [[Commonwealth Fusion Systems]] and the [[MIT Plasma Science & Fusion Center]]. Phase 1 consisted of the [[Toroidal field model coil]]. Phase 2 will culminate in the construction and commissioning of the SPARC device.

SPARC will:
- Will inject up to 5% helium, ~1% Xenon and Krypton, and neon and argon, to manage the plasma.
- Torus pressure is much less than 1 Pa most of the time, but up to 1 Pa at the end of the pulse.
- The tritium plant does 10 kPa-m3 hydrogenics per day
