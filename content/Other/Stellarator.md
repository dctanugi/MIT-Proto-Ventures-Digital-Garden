A class of magnetic confinement reactor for [[Nuclear fusion]]. 

Advantages of stellarators include:
- High triple product (plasma temperature $T \approx 10 keV$, plasma density $n_e \approx 10^{20} m^{-3}$, and plasma duration)
- Low recirculating power
- Steady-state operation

New stellarator designs leverage recent innovations in:
- Advanced optimization
- Advanced design, manufacturing techniques, and materials
- [[High-temperature superconducting magnets]] (including MIT's [[VIPER cable]], but also potentially CORC and STAR with LBL)

Example companies commercializing a stellarator include [[Type One Energy]].
