>[[MIT Proto Ventures]] identifies the innovative people, ideas, and technologies from across the MIT campus and brings them together to create new pathways for talent and transformative technology ventures

New pathways for talent, eh?

>To use knowledge and MIT’s exceptional people to solve the world’s great challenges in Fusion and Clean Energy

The world's great challenges and clean energy. Pretty vague.

Process:
- Channel definition
- Discover: 6 months of searching for opportunities
- Explore: Form teams and prototype solutions and business models
- Build: Down-select and further de-risk
- Launch

Ask about:
- Fusion vs clean energy
- Weekly deliverables and sprint events
- Monthly technical seminars and brown-bags
- 'External fellowships'
- Summer PhD Fellowship Program (funding required)
