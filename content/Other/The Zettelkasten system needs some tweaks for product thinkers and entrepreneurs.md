The [[Zettelkasten]] system seems designed for academics. After all, its inventory was a social scientist and an introvert.

For example:
- There is no concept of meeting notes, or of interacting with other human beings more generally. My inclination is to treat meeting notes like bibliography notes, in an 'Inputs' folder.
- There is no obvious way to put data, or visualizations, into Zettelkasten notes.
