Smart [[thermostats]] bid for the right to keep using electricity. If they lose the bid, they have to adjust the setpoint to avoid using energy.

The real-time market (5 min market) is where the transactive energy opportunity gets real.
Double auction: the buyers submit their acutions, the suppliers all submit their bids, the algorithm creates the supply & demand curve, that generates a clearing price.

How do we incorporate DERs?
Quantity on the X axis, $ on the Y axis. The demand line slopes down.
What if the PV and EVs were connected together in an energy market. They have a willingness to pay for charging their EV. In the middle of the day, the supply curve shifts out since there is a lot of solar generation. The cars that have most willingness to pay will charge higher. 
SLAC + Holy Cross Energy --> TESS (Transactive Energy Service System). Mostly working on market design, but also building out the platform. She focuses on bottom-up economics and price discovery in a complex system.
Having 20% of load be fully price responsive gets you 80% of the benefit.
There is a coincident peak charge that Holy Cross is trying to avoid.
Transactive Energy is a more efficient alternative to [[net metering]].
