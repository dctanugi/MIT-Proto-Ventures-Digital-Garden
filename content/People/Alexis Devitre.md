## About
>I’m a graduate student at the [[MIT Plasma Science & Fusion Center]]. I work under [[Dennis Whyte]] and [[Mike Short]] on the radiation tolerance of superconductors. We try to emulate fusion reactor conditions (field, temperature, particle bombardment) using protons, and eventually neutrons. My subgroup also includes [[David Fischer]] (Research Scientist) and [[Zoe L Fisher]] (Master soon PhD student).
