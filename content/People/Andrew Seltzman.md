## About
Andrew is a plasma physicist at [[MIT Plasma Science & Fusion Center|PSFC]]. He focuses on plasma heating and current drive, but also materials, especially new alloys for fusion applications.

He describes himself as:
>PhD Graduate with a sound understanding of experimental plasma physics, high power RF and pulsed power systems. Excellent working knowledge in RF engineering, x-ray diagnostics, and practical electromagnetic design, including ability to develop simulations and design prototypes; Electrical engineering background in high voltage pulsed power and control systems.

Andrew works on [[High-power radio-frequency technology|High-power RF]] applications to [[Nuclear fusion]], primarily for the purposes of [[Lower hybrid current drive (LHCD)]].
- He is interested in patenting his inventions, and has filed at least one provisional. He hasn't much luck getting the attention from the [[MIT Technology License Office|MIT TLO]], however. His aspiration is to be a professor.
- Andrew's current work is on developing an LHCD current drive for the DIII-D tokamak. His main innovation is to put the "launchers" inside the hole of the tokamak donut, as opposed around the outside. 
- Andrew has done a lot of work on the manufacturing of LHCD components, particularly the launchers (which direct the RF waves and are hidden, in his design, behind the tungsten tiles in the scrape-off layer contacting the plasma). In particular:
	- The use of metal [[Additive manufacturing]] with high-strength alloys
	- Special metal alloys that don't contain any high-activation elements like Nb
	- Post-processing like welding and polishing for an optimal waveguide performance
