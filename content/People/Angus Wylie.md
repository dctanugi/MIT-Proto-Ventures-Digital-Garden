## About
[[Angus Wylie]] works on the laser lab in [[Mike Short]]'s group. They use [[Transient grating spectroscopy (TGS)]] with interfering lasers to evaluate surface properties (i.e. thermal properties and elastic properties) _to a variable depth_. They are especially interested in performing in-situ measurements.

The Short lab is using this technique for:
- Calibrating ion beam exposure to emulate neutron exposure
- [[Portable transient grating spectroscopy device]]
- Plasma and in-situ irradiation TGS
- Behavior of REBCO tape under irradiation
- Remedying the poor ductility of tungsten by exploring W-Ta alloys
- Collaboration with [[Sandia National Laboratory]] for structural materials
