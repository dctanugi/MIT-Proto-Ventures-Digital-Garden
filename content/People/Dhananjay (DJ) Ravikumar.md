## About
>Iâ€™m Dhananjay (DJ) Ravikumar, cryogenic research engineer at the [[MIT Plasma Science & Fusion Center|PSFC]]. My supervisor and I have come up with a solid-state sub-kelvin refrigeration system that could potentially be used to cool quantum computers and replace large, traditional fluid-based machines that are unscalable and resource limited.
- DJ is a high-energy physicist by background. He did his PhD and postdoc at Stony Brook, and now works in cryogenics.
- He initially led cryogenics work for the [[SPARC tokamak]], then worked on the [[Toroidal field model coil]] with [[Zach Hartwig]]
- He now works with [[John Brisson]] on cryogenics. In particular, he is trying to replace [dilution refrigeration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilution_refrigerator) technology in quantum computing applications.
- DJ has a daughter who was born in 2018.
- He went through the Blueprint program at [[The Engine]].
