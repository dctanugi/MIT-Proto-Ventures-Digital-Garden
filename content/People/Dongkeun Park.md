## About
[[Dongkeun Park]] is a [[High-temperature superconducting magnets]] researcher. EE by background. Mostly systems engineering nowadays. Relies on commercial superconducting tapes. 

His focus is on high field [[Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)]] and [[MRI]]. His research is mostly funded by NIH. Previously did some DoE work for [[muon collider]].

Recently proposed a magnet for [[Gyrotron]] to heat the plasma. 

His goal is to develop new magnets that have very high fields (e.g. for NMRs for high signal:noise ratio). Conventional LTS cannot reach these high fields. The major challenge is very high mechanical stresses, which requires specific materials and good mechanical design.

The field must also be very homogeneous for NMR and MRI, which requires correction.
