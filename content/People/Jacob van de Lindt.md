## About
Jacob is a PhD student at [[MIT Plasma Science & Fusion Center|PSFC]].
>Hi everyone! My name is Jacob van de Lindt. I grew up in Portland Oregon, and completed my undergraduate degree in nuclear fission engineering and physics at Oregon State University, with minors in aerospace engineering and math. I spent a lovely summer in Southern France working at the ITER Tokamak, and as an engineer at SpaceX after graduating before coming to MIT. Here at MIT, I am researching fusion RF heating systems at the PSFC. While here, I have also sharpened my fission skillset. I believe there is an untapped potential between fusion's accomplishments and fission's 70+ years of engineering excellence and recent advancements. I think a unique market need could be met by exploiting this synergy.
