## About
Rodrigo is an Assistant Professor of Materials Science and Engineering at MIT.

He is interested in [[High-entropy materials]], especially in "short-range order", which could mitigate radiation-induced defects (in other words, lower defect density for a given dose in dpa).

Computationally, he can compute SRO domain size for any chemical composition, which lets you tune the chemistry to enhance precipitate formation, which could accelerate the development of radiation-resistant high entropy alloys.
