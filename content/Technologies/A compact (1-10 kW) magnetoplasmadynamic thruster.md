## Other comments by Theo
>At Pe = 150 kW - Reported 76.6 % efficiency, Isp = 5714 s, Thrust of 4N, with 0.56 T solenoidal field. If valid, remarkable results.

>Efficiency is the main stunner here - one other previous reference I found reports ~ 72 % efficiency - idea is both effect of axial field to act as magnetic nozzle and increasingly convert ion energy to axial kinetic energy, and also reduce ion bombardment on cathode, reducing energy loss.

>Could be interesting to explore ourselves. Market potential too.
Question is, can we scale down to equivalent Hall thruster/ion thruster power levels, whilst maintaining efficiency and Isp  - then you have a winner.

>I think HTS coil TRL for this app. is in a good spot for industry - tape on tape solenoid or similar. Integrate with liquid cryogen free pulse tube.
> Market assessment - is there a near-term opening for 1 - 10 kW thruster class? Starlink? (Or you go big and target Mars/Moon cargo missions but big 100 kw - 1 MW power needed - less enticing)
> TRL of thruster at these powers needs to be a little higher for market - MPD historically has problem with surface to volume ratio effect causing large losses at small sizes. Build small thruster & test - does HTS field alleviate these issues at compact sizes? (With ~ double to triple ion/Hall Isp, & potential for 10^2-10^3 increase in thrust levels)â€‹

> Is HTS enabling tech for MPDs? Speaking to a couple AeroA guys who might be interested to scope out. Due diligence on MPD basics & history required - talk to Martinez - Sanchez, Lozano, Carmen, etc.
