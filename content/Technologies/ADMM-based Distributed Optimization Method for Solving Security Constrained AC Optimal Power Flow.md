## Description of capability
[[Andy Sun]] et al. have developed an efficient and robust computational method for solving the security-constrained alternating current optimal power flow (SC-ACOPF) problem, a two-stage nonlinear optimization problem with disjunctive constraints, that is central to the operation of electric power grids. 

## Key people
[[Andy Sun]]

## Technology Readiness Level (1-9)
5

## Needs that this could potentially address
[[Extremely fast AC Optimal Power Flow optimization models]]

## Tech specs
The proposed algorithms can produce high-quality solutions in a very restricted time framework for real world-sized power grids up to 30,000 buses and 22,000 contingencies.

## Estimated time & cost to commercialize
1-2 years

## Outstanding risks
Market adoption and business model
