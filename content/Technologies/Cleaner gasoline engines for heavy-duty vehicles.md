## Description of capability
[[Daniel R Cohn]] and [[Leslie Bromberg]] propose a gasoline-ethanol engine that is cleaner and more cost-effective than existing diesel engine technologies to help meet vehicle emission reduction goals.

This includes the use of flex-fuel ethanolÂ spark-ignition engines, as well as enhanced exhaust treatment for near-zero NOx emissions.
