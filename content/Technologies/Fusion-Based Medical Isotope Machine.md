## Description of capability
- [[Kuba Anglin]] proposes creating small, modular neutron generators based on [[Nuclear fusion]] that provide on-demand production of [[Medical isotopes]].
- You'd place them near hospitals, inside hospitals, or on wheels.
- Enables customization to create different isotopes. Includes making a proton source instead of a neutron source.
- Proposed technology roadmap:
	1. Beam-target fusion: Deuteron beam hits a tritium target (stored in a metal hydride). [[Shine Technologies]] is already doing this. But could improve upon this: maybe you load cobalt up with tritium. Maybe you cool it with a cryostat to 4 K for higher efficiency.
	2. Beam-beam fusion. Shoot a deuteron beam and a triton beam in the same place. You could use [[High-temperature superconducting magnets|HTS magnets]] to focus the beam.
 - Next steps: target design:
	- Titanium hydride with tritium embedded (to create neutrons).
	- 20% enriched uranium to receive the neutrons and make the medical isotope precursors. Also makes plutonium, though...
- The separation to get pure Mo-99 is "really easy" step according to Kuba.
