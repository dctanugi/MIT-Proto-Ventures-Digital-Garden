## Description of capability
[[REBCO superconducting material]] could enable a better [[Gyrotron]] device for [[Electron cyclotron heating]] in [[Nuclear fusion]] plants, especially in tokamaks and stellarators.

One caveat: according to [[Richard J. Temkin]], MIT isn't sitting on any magical inventions for how to make gyrotrons significantly better than they are today. Moreover, the four major suppliers of [[Gyrotron]]s are well entrenched, so it will be difficult to disrupt the gyrotron industry. 

### Background
There are four major ways of heating a plasma in a tokamak:
- [[Electron cyclotron heating]] (EHC)
- [[Ion cyclotron range of frequencies (ICRF) heating]]
- [[Lower hybrid current drive (LHCD)]]
- Ohmic heating

Ohmic heating stops working at plasma temperatures above ~2 eV because plasmas become less resistive as they heat up. ICRF is not ideal for a power plant because of heat challenges, and because the components must be in close proximity to the plasma.

### Why do we need a better gyrotron for fusion?
ECH is preferred for a fusion power plant. You control the plasma by moving the RF beam to targeted parts of the plasma. However, new tokamak designs like the UK's STEP [[Spherical tokamak]] or [[Commonwealth Fusion Systems|CFS]]'s [[ARC tokamak]], as well as any [[Stellarator]] (like [[Type One Energy]]), will require a new kind of gyrotron to produce ECH:
- The cyclo frequency of electrons is determined the magnitude of the magnetic field only. Thus, the gyrotron frequency must be 28x the value of the magnetic field. That's ~350 GHz for an [[ARC tokamak]]. Today's gyrotrons can't really drive at these ultra high frequencies.
- Need commensurately high power density
- Need higher wall plug efficiency (currently only ~30%)
- Need durability
- Need a reliable supply chain:
	- The major supplier to date has been GyCom, a Russia-based company
	- Other established players (Varian?) seem to be exiting the gyrotron business

Designing this 'better gyrotron' for fusion will require new innovations, including:
- The use of [[REBCO superconducting material]] for higher-field [[High-temperature superconducting magnets]] inside the gyrotron
- RF physics
- Power handling and power electronics
- Modern manufacturing approaches, including to cool or replace the collector, which gets blasted during operation

To be clear, [[SPARC tokamak|SPARC]] doesn't need a gyrotron. And [[ARC tokamak]] could definitely use a gyrotron, but it is not strictly necessary, which is a good thing since the device doesn't exist yet.

[[Bridge 12]] has an [[ARPA-e]] GAMOW project to build a 250 GHz at 1 ms pulse length 1 MW of power with 65% efficiency.
