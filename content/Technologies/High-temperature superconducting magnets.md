## Description of capability
Large-scale magnets capable of high magnetic fields, typically using superconducting tape such as [[REBCO superconducting material]]. This benefits from [[High-field magnet design]].

## Key people
[[John Brisson]]
[[Dongkeun Park]]
[[Zach Hartwig]]

## Technology Readiness Level (1-9)
5
## Needs that this could potentially address
Not sure yet. But applications include:
- [[Nuclear fusion]]
- Energy storage (for example in the form of [[Superconducting magnetic energy storage systems]])
- [[Electric Transmission]], including power cables, [[Better fault current limiters for power grid]], and transformers
- Wind turbines and other generators (e.g. [[Magnetohydrodynamic generators|MHD generators]])
- Electric motors
- [[Superconducting magnetic energy storage systems]]
- [[Hyperion Transport Systems]]
## Tech specs

## Estimated time & cost to commercialize

## Outstanding risks
-  Foreign competition
- Commodification: reel-to-reel technologies get cheap really fast.
- [[Bob Mumgaard]] expressed some concern with commercial applications of [[High-temperature superconducting magnets]], for several reasons:
		- [[Commonwealth Fusion Systems|CFS]] owns a lot of the IP
		- [[REBCO superconducting material]] is too expensive for most commercial applications
		- His team has found that most of the applications would involve putting a new component in a bigger system (e.g. [[Better generators in wind turbines]], [[Portable MRI for ambulatory medical diagnostics]]), and that the OEMs of these bigger systems (wind turbines, MRIs) are not eager to adopt these supposedly new components unless there is a full proof of concept of the better system. You may need to build the better system yourself, i.e. start a wind turbine company rather than a wind turbine generator company. That takes a lot of capital and many years.
- [[Zach Hartwig]] cautioned that there isn't a great market for cables today. There are a few mom & pop shops like [[Advanced Conductor Technologies]] in Colorado. The market is small, the tape is expensive.
