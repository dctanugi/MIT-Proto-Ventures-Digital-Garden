## Summary
Normally, people use low-activation steel (see [[Low-activation materials]]) coated with copper. But the steel has poor thermal conductivity, and plating copper is hard. Some new copper alloys ([GRCOP](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20190033311))are promising but they contain 4% Nb, which would make it "high-level waste". So [[Gregory Wallace]] and [[Mike Short]] are collaborating on a high-throughput alloy synthesis and testing system, supported by molecular dynamics simulations. (Note: [[Mike Short]] is also applying this technique to other applications with [[Kevin Woller]]). This is funded by the Department of Energy.

This is adjacent to work by [[Andrew Seltzman]] (see [[2023-05-15 A-STAR (Singapore Research Entity)]]).
