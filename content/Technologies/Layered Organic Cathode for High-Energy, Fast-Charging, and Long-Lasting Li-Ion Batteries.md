## Description of capability
Aa layered organic electrode material whose high electrical conductivity, high storage capacity, and complete insolubility enable reversible intercalation of Li+ ions, allowing it to compete at the electrode level, in all relevant metrics, with inorganic-based lithium-ion battery cathodes.

## Key people
[[Mircea Dincă]]

## Technology Readiness Level (1-9)
3

## Needs that this could potentially address
Li-ion batteries that require less critical minerals

## Tech specs

>306 mAh g–1cathode, delivers an energy density of 765 Wh kg–1cathode, higher than most cobalt-based cathodes, and can charge–discharge in as little as 6 min.

## Estimated time & cost to commercialize
Stealth mode startup under way

## Outstanding risks
- Lamborghini has reportedly licensed the patent on the technology.
