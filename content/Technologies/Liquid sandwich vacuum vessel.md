## Description of capability
[[MIT Plasma Science & Fusion Center|PSFC]] is developing a vacuum vessel for fusion that can withstand plasma disruptions. It relies on SiC with molten lead channels.

Some context: in a [[Nuclear fusion]] reactor, the fusion reaction happens inside a vacuum vessel, a hermetically sealed steel container that houses the fusion reactions and acts as a first safety containment barrier. It accomplishes several aims:
1. Provide a high-vacuum environment for the plasma
2. Shields radiation and radioactivity

In the [[SPARC tokamak|SPARC]] design, the liquid sandwich vacuum vessel goes something like this:
Plasma >> SiC >> Lead >> SiC >> FLiBe
