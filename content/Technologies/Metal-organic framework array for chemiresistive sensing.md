## Description of capability
- Porous, conductive, MOFs. Can use them as chemiresistors. Any analyte that comes in contact with them changes their resistivity, with much higher sensitivity, and good selectivity.
- They make MOFs that are mixtures (e.g. with Cu, Ni, and Co). From there, they make *arrays* with all the combinations. With signal processing, you can deconvolute how each analyte triggers the full array.

## Technology Readiness Level (1-9)
2

## Needs that this could potentially address
- Military applications. Sense gases, nerve agents, chemical weapons, explosives, radiation.
- Detecting methane leaks. Hydrogen leaks.
- Others?

## Tech specs
- Can detect anything that can fit in a 2mm diameter pore (6-7 carbons max):
	- NH3
	- NO2
	- Sulfurated vapors
	- Others

## Estimated time & cost to commercialize
- Two patents filed (not about the signal processing part)

## Outstanding risks
