## Description of capability
Several research groups, including [[Rohit Karnik]]'s group at MIT, can produce high quality porous graphene. The graphene is currently sourced externally but it could be produced by the same entity. The pores are produced via plasma etching or some other technique from the semiconductor industry.

## Key people

## Technology Readiness Level (1-9)
2

## Needs that this could potentially address


## Tech specs
- Most samples are at the inch scale
- 

## Estimated time & cost to commercialize
- 6-8 years for earliest applications
- $50M to first product?

## Outstanding risks
- Cost of graphene. According to [[Rohit Karnik]]:
>The cost of graphene is high but will drop with scale. You can now buy roll-based furnaces ($50K) to produce graphene. Then it becomes a few dollars per m2+ copper foil.
- Difficulty of producing high quality porous graphene at scale
