## Description of capability
Superconducting transformers leverage the unique properties of superconductors to efficiently transmit and transform electrical power. These transformers utilize materials like [[REBCO superconducting material]] that exhibit zero electrical resistance when cooled to extremely low temperatures, allowing for minimal energy loss during power transmission.

## Key people
[[Joseph V Minervini]]

## Technology Readiness Level (1-9)
5-7

## Needs that this could potentially address
[[Readily available electric transformers]]

## Tech specs


## Estimated time & cost to commercialize
5-10 years

## Outstanding risks
1. **Cryogenic Challenges:** Maintaining the required low operating temperatures at all times poses technical and engineering challenges.
2. **Material Costs:** Superconducting materials can be expensive, affecting the overall cost-effectiveness of the technology.
3. **Scale-up Issues:** Achieving large-scale production while maintaining performance and reliability can be challenging.
4. **Adoption**: Utilities are reluctant to adopt anything new. Storage projects (e.g. [[Form Energy]]) might be a better early customer segment.
