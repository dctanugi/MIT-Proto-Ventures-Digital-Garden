## Description of capability
[[Joseph V Minervini]], [[John Brisson]], et al. have developed a thermal switch for cryocoolers that lets you cool things down a lot quicker.
- The thermal switch could be mounted on a commercial cryocooler unit, or a new cryocooler could be developed.
- Cryocoolers are sold by the thousands per year, mostly for [[MRI]] devices.
- Next steps: need more development money and need to work with an established cryocooler company like [[Sumitomo Corporation]], or Cryomech.
