## Description of capability
Any fusion company that uses [[FLiBe]] will need ultra-high temperature materials. Why? [[FLiBe]] melts at 450 ºC. But it's very viscous then. You need 550ºC to be non-viscous. So your hot side needs to be 650 ºC. In practice, more like **750ºC**. Vanadium can withstand this, but almost no other structural material can.

- Vanadium alloys were extensively considered for fusion and fission a few decades ago.
- Vanadium are higher yield strength than almost everything except nickel-based alloys, which have high activation in a neutron environment.

- Vanadium has three Achilles' heels:
	- They suck up gases (including tritium) and embrittle 
	- They can't be in contact with the plasma because they sputter too much
	- They get shredded by molten salts like [[FLiBe]]
- [[Mike Short]], [[Myles Stapelberg]], [[Commonwealth Fusion Systems]] (Cody Dennett) conceived of a vacuum vessel that is tungsten, vanadium, tungsten, aka "WVWVV". 

- Embodiments:
	- Cooling channels in the vacuum vessel
	- Vacuum vessel wall itself
	- "Neutron gate valve" (add a layer like boron carbide to prevent back-neutrons from coming back through the vacuum vessel)
