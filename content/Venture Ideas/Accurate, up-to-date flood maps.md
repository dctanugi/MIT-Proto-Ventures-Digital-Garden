## Description of venture idea
- There is a big need for updates to FEMA flood maps (for example for insurance companies and real estate developers, reinsurance companies, and municipal governments)
- The first product might be the FEMA flood map "delta". Google Earth and others are doing AI for new flood map probability predictions, but nobody will buy it because they don't trust it (unlike FEMA flood maps).

## Market needs this venture would address
- Accurate risk assessment for insurance companies and real estate developers, reinsurance companies, and municipal governments
- See [[Adapting to inevitable global warming and the associated disruptions]]

## Technical capabilities this venture might leverage
- Software techniques developed in the [[Kerri Cahoy]] group at MIT
- Uses [[Synthetic aperture radar]], optical image, and LIDAR data

## Business model
Unknown. Data as a service?

## Team
- Mary Dahl
- Madeline Loui
- [[Kerri Cahoy]]

## Outstanding risks
Competition. Google Earth, etc.
