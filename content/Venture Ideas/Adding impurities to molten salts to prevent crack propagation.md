## Description of capability
People have been looking at beryllium rods to prevent corrosion in contact with [[FLiBe]], but the Be can't diffuse all the way so crevices will still appear. 

[[Mike Short]]'s group is working on intentional additions of Fe or Si to prevent crack propagation. Tune the concentration such that it only happens reducing. 

## Key people
