## Description of venture idea
A variety of industries require high-performance metal components that can only be produced using advanced manufacturing techniques. For example,  [[Nuclear fusion]] power plants require [[Plasma heating solutions that can deliver tens of megawatts at high duty cycle for several years]]. Many fusion plant designs will rely on RF heating, which will require [[RF antennas that can withstand fusion conditions]].

This venture sells components such as RF antennas and associated equipment like waveguides. 

It uses advanced manufacturing methods that include additive manufacturing, selection of high-performance metal alloys, and precision post-processing steps.  

## Market needs this venture would address
[[RF antennas that can withstand fusion conditions]]
Markets include fusion, the communications industry, and aerospace (rocket engines).

## Technical capabilities this venture might leverage
- [[Additive manufacturing for RF antennas]]
- [[High-throughput alloy design for fusion RF antennas]]
- Special metal alloys that don't contain any high-activation elements like Nb (see [[Low-activation materials]])
- Post-processing like welding and polishing for an optimal waveguide performance
