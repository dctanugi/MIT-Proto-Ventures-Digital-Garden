## Description of venture idea
Chimera Marine is developing a fusion/fission hybrid for cargo ships.

## Market needs this venture would address
[[Decarbonizing maritime shipping]]

## Technical capabilities this venture might leverage
[[Fusion-fission hybrid with magnetic mirror and fast reactor blanket]]

## Business model
"Propulsion as a service" - full service for ship owner/operators like Maersk.

## Team
[[Jacob van de Lindt]] and [[Nelson van de Lindt]]

## Outstanding risks
- Regulation
- Waste or safety is no better than a fission system, so might as well just do a fast fission reactor
- Plasma heating for the mirror is nontrivial
- Accident scenarios and public acceptance. Key failure modes:
	- loss of coolant scenario
	- prompt supercritical, e.g. system gets flooded with water that replaces the liquid Pb
	- the ship sinks, with resulting tritium and radioactive material leakage
