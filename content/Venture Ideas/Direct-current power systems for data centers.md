## Description of venture idea
Provides equipment and technologies for DC power systems in data centers and other facilities with critical electrical loads. Leverages technologies like [[Rutherford-type superconducting cable]], [[Superconducting magnetic energy storage systems]] (SMES), [[Automated variable speed drive for flywheels|automated variable speed drives]] and [[Passive magnetic bearing design for flywheels]], and [[Better fault current limiters for power grid|superconducting fault current limiters]].

## Market needs this venture would address
- [[Power quality issues on a grid with heavy renewables penetration]]
- [[More efficient and economical power distribution in microgrids and data centers]]

In more detail (according to ChatGPT, not fully fact checked but looks reasonable):
1. **Voltage Fluctuations and Flicker**: SMES systems can rapidly respond to changes in renewable energy output by injecting or absorbing power from the grid. This capability allows them to smooth out voltage fluctuations and mitigate flicker, ensuring a more stable voltage profile.
2. **Frequency Variability**: SMES can provide frequency regulation by adjusting the power flow into or out of the grid. This helps maintain a stable grid frequency even when there are rapid changes in renewable energy generation.    
3. **Voltage Sags and Swells**: SMES can quickly release stored energy during voltage sags, helping to raise the grid voltage and prevent equipment malfunctions. Conversely, during voltage swells, SMES can absorb excess energy, preventing overvoltage conditions.    
4. **Harmonics and Interharmonics**: The rapid response time of SMES systems allows them to mitigate harmonic distortions by injecting compensating currents in real time, thereby improving the overall quality of the voltage and current waveforms.    
5. **Voltage Unbalance**: SMES can help balance power distribution among different phases of a three-phase system, reducing voltage unbalance and its associated negative effects.    
6. **Grid Resonance**: SMES systems can dampen oscillations and reduce resonant frequencies, contributing to the suppression of grid resonance issues.    
7. **Voltage Regulation Challenges**: SMES can enhance voltage control mechanisms by providing quick and accurate adjustments to grid voltage levels.    
8. **Islanding Events**: In the event of an islanding scenario, SMES can provide stable and continuous power output, supporting the isolated portion of the grid until reconnection is established.

## Technical capabilities this venture might leverage
1. **Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage Systems ([[Superconducting magnetic energy storage systems|SMES]]):** Utilizing superconducting materials to store and release energy efficiently, providing rapid response times to grid fluctuations.
2. **[[Automated variable speed drive for flywheels]]:** Employing automated systems to control the speed of flywheels, offering a dynamic and responsive approach to grid stabilization.
3. **[[Passive magnetic bearing design for flywheels]]:** Implementing passive magnetic bearings to reduce friction, enhance reliability, and improve the overall efficiency of flywheel-based energy storage systems.
4. **[[Better fault current limiters for power grid|Superconducting Fault Current Limiters]]:** Deploying fault current limiters based on superconducting technology to protect the grid from electrical faults and disruptions.
