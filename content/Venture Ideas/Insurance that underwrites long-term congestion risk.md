## Description of venture idea
Insurance that underwrites long-term congestion / curtailment risk. This enables project developers to apply for energy-only interconnection (which is a much faster process) with far greater revenue certainty.

## Market needs this venture would address
For developers of renewables, battery storage, and large load (e.g. data centers), helps them get interconnected faster in order to start commercial operation sooner

## Technical capabilities this venture might leverage
New software that performs congestion/curtailment analysis for all settlement points in a grid.

## Business model
TBD

## Team


## Outstanding risks & critical hypotheses
- Limiting the financial exposure of a project to congestion would make energy-only interconnection much more attractive for developers and offtakers  
- Projects can find ways to make up for the lack of capacity market revenue (unavailable for energy-only interconnection)  
- This kind of analysis is technically feasible and would be reasonably accurate  
- The financial math works out, i.e. attractive numbers for both the underwriter and the project  
- ‚ùå In ERCOT, financing projects is challenging or expensive due to the curtailment risk
