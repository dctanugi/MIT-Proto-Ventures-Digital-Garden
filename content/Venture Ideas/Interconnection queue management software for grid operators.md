## Description of venture idea
Software that helps form optimal clusters, manage clusters, automates the tracking of FERC-imposed deadlines, automates the publishing of queue updates to the public

## Market needs this venture would address
For ISOs/RTOs, utilities, and/or their interconnection consultants (e.g. [[Black & Veatch]]), helps them manage an increasingly complex interconnection queue, including clusters.

## Technical capabilities this venture might leverage
Status quo is Excel, apparently. The main differentiation would be modern, user-friendly software. The formation of optimal clusters would require some new cool tech approaches.

## Business model
TBD

## Team


## Outstanding risks & critical hypotheses
- Queue management is a major pain point for ISOs today  
- Many ISOs are not ready for FERC 2023, especially re: handling clusters  
- The interconnection queue could be significantly shortened by better formation and handling of clusters
