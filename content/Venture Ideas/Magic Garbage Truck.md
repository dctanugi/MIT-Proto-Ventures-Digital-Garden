up:: [[Landfills]]
## Description of venture idea
Let's rethink landfills and waste.

## Market needs this venture would address
TBD
- A relevant customer would be electronics manufacturers like [[Apple]] who are now being faced with"Extended Producer Responsibility" legislation. It becomes their problem if the end customer throws out the Apple laptop in the trash and it goes in a landfill.
## Technical capabilities this venture might leverage
TBD

## Business model


## Team
[[Jeff Grossman]]
[[Elsa Olivetti]]

## Outstanding risks
- Team:
	- Do we know enough about the problem?
	- Do we know enough about the solution (are we the right people to build it?)
	- Can we "get things done"?
- Can we get the technology far enough in the next 12 months?
- Economics?

## Resources
- [[Closed Loop Partners]] ([[Hannah Friedman]] used to work there).
	- They now offer "circular services".
	- Ron Gonenz and [Jessica Long](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessicalongprofile). Talk to Jessica.
