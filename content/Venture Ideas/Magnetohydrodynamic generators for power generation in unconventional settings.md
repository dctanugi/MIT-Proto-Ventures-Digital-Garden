## Description of venture idea
Commercialize [[Magnetohydrodynamic generators]] as a solution to produce power from a heat source in unconventional settings in which conventional generation approaches based on a turbine or an engine are not feasible.

## Market needs this venture would address
TBD. Early ideas include:
- Remote astrophysics observatories where power lines aren't available and the vibrations & noise from a turbine or engine would interfere with the research activities.
- Nuclear submarines?
- Military options where stealth is at a premium

## Technical capabilities this venture might leverage
[[Magnetohydrodynamic generators]]

## Business model

## Team
None
## Outstanding risks
- Market is too small
- Existing power generation solutions are actually acceptable
- All the technical risks described in [[Magnetohydrodynamic generators|MHD generators]]
