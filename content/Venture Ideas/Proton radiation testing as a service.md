## Description of venture idea
Companies that are developing materials for [[Nuclear fusion]] and [[Nuclear fission]] need a convenient way to test the behavior of their materials under heavy particle irradiation.

This venture would let these companies send in material samples, specify what kind of proton loading conditions they want, and we would expose each sample to the desired irradiation using a neutron source.

## Market needs this venture would address
* [[Understanding materials degradation in a nuclear fission reactor]]
* [[Understanding materials degradation in a deuterium-tritium fusion environment]]

## Technical capabilities this venture might leverage
- [[Cyclotron proton source]]

## Business model
Radiation testing as a service: pay per material sample

## Team
[[Lou Wainwright]]

## Outstanding risks
- Overhead costs will be very high, which may rule out the profit margins expected for a conventional VC-backed startup. (see [[2023-11-30 Proto Ventures Channel Forum]] feedback)
