## Description of venture idea
This venture produces and sells a standardized interconnection hardware system for commercial businesses.

## First Product
- A standardized, modular physical system consisting of two 50-ft containers. Requires <3,000 sqft, including fire and access setbacks.
- Built and tested in a factory, and delivered onsite.
- Provides 20 MWh of resiliency to let the customer keep running critical operations (e.g. refrigerators and freezers, processing payments) and to minimize demand charges.
- Takes whatever the feeder voltage is (12 kV or 7.2 kV or whatever) and converts down to the desired end-use voltage (typically 480 V or 208 V), for example using coreless or solid-state transformers.
- Also includes [circuit recloser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recloser), [relays](https://www.galco.com/comp/prod/relay.htm) (to deal with undercurrent, undervoltage, etc.), and customer-owned meter, a transformer to step up the voltage to grid discharge, and similarly, to step down to grid charge


> [!NOTE] Note
> Not super relevant for data centers: Data centers will be such big loads, a single container won't do anything for them. 
## Market needs this venture would address
- Faster interconnection process for commercial businesses (e.g. big-box stores) by virtue of not requiring any complex transformer or switchgear work on the part of the utility.

## Technical capabilities this venture might leverage
- [[Alex Q. Huang]] at UT Austin does hybrid transformers, part semiconductor and part copper coils. Lets you have a much higher power transformer that can be pole-mounted and where you can control the voltage.
- [[High-Power High-Frequency Coreless Transformer]]

## Business model
- Likely sell or rent these standardized containers.

## Team
None

## Outstanding risks
TBD
