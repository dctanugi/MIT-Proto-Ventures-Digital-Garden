## Description of venture idea
Commercializes advanced materials that can withstand strong neutron radiation. These materials will have been developed and tested using a [[Cyclotron proton source]] at MIT or elsewhere.

## Market needs this venture would address
- Radiation-resistant materials for fusion (e.g. [[Plasma-facing materials that can withstand fusion conditions]], [[Blanket materials that can withstand fusion temperatures without corroding or soaking up tritium]], [[Neutron shield materials for fusion]])
- Radiation-resistant materials for nuclear fission
- Radiation-resistant materials for space applications

## Technical capabilities this venture might leverage
[[Cyclotron proton source]]

## Business model
- Sell raw materials (e.g. ingots) of advanced materials?
- Produce and sell fully manufactured parts?
- License to established materials companies

## Team
[[Lou Wainwright]]

## Outstanding risks
TAM
