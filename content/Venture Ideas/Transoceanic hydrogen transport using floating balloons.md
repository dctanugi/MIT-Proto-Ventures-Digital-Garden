up:: [[Clean hydrogen]]
## Description of venture idea
It's expected that some countries will produce significant amounts of green hydrogen, while other countries will want to important a lot of hydrogen. Many people are scratching their heads around how to transport hydrogen across oceans: liquid hydrogen, ammonia, metallic zinc, etc.

What if we just put the hydrogen in gigantic balloons (basically zeppelins)? 

## Market needs this venture would address
[[Transporting hydrogen]]

## Technical capabilities this venture might leverage
Zeppelins?

A typical oil tanker carries 20 million gallons of oil. That is roughly the same energy content as 20 million kg of hydrogen. Compare with a floating zeppelin which would only cary somewhere on the order of 50,000 kg of hydrogen. So it takes 400 zeppelins to carry the energy of one oil tanker. Not great.
