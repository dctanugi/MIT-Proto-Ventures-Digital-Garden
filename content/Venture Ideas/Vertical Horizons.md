aka "High-efficiency power supplies for data centers using wide band-gap semiconductors"
## Description of venture idea
[[Data centers]] face significant challenges with heat from the servers. Novel semiconductors, including [[Wide bandgap semiconductors]] such as [[gallium nitride]] could unlock efficiency gains in data center design, cooling infrastructure (capex), and energy use (opex).

## Market needs this venture would address
- Energy consumption and heat management in [[Data centers]]
- Power quality and reliability in [[Data centers]]

## Technical capabilities this venture might leverage
- [[Vertical gallium nitride superjunction power devices]] ([[Tomas Palacios]] Lab, MIT)

## Business model
TBD

## Team
[[Cynthia Liao]]
[[Hee Yau Phoon]]
[[Tomas Palacios]]

## Outstanding risks
TBD
