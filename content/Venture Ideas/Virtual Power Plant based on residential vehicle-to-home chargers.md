## Description of venture idea
This company runs a [[Virtual Power Plants]] that primarily aggregates residential consumers with [[Vehicle-to-Home (V2H)]] chargers. Motivates consumers to get bidirectional charging, shows them how much money they’ll save, helps them unlock the rebates from utilities, tell them what utility programs are available (DR, VPP, “overbooked flight”) and how much they should expect to gain, handles the permitting and inspections, including at dealerships, and get paid by utilities.
