## About Proto Ventures
[[MIT Proto Ventures]] is MIT’s venture studio — a new model for entrepreneurship and venture building at MIT that identifies the innovative people, ideas, and technologies from across the MIT campus and brings them together to create new pathways for talent and transformative technology ventures.

The objective of the Fusion & Clean Energy Channel is to deploy one or more innovations that leverage MIT research — with an emphasis on the [[MIT Plasma Science & Fusion Center]] — and that will have a strong positive impact in the clean energy sector. In doing so, we are advancing Proto Ventures’ vision of using knowledge and MIT’s exceptional people to solve the world’s great challenges in fusion and clean energy.

My role as a Venture Builder focused on opportunities in clean energy, with an emphasis on technologies from the [[MIT Plasma Science & Fusion Center]] but also spanning many other areas of [[MIT]].

## About This Website
This site is a snapshot of my notes and learnings as a Venture Builder as of February 2025. 

It was generated from my working notes about venture ideas, market needs, technological capabilities, and relevant people who could form the basis for new clean energy ventures at MIT. I do all of my note-taking using [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md), which I use as a personal knowledge management system.

The table of contents in the left sidebar contains Companies, Market Needs, Technologies, Venture Ideas, and other notes.
