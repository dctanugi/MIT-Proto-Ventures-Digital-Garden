# About This Vault
[Proto Ventures](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Xz2Z0bSD-t1luELDSsl4vbN2dSlyFbVunqLC_wcEjt4/edit#slide=id.p2) is MIT’s venture studio — a new model for entrepreneurship and venture building at MIT that identifies the innovative people, ideas, and technologies from across the MIT campus and brings them together to create new pathways for talent and transformative technology ventures.

This Obsidian vault is a snapshot of my notes and learnings as a Venture Builder, 2023-2024. You can reach me at davidctanugi@gmail.com.
# Personal Vision
My name is [[David Cohen-Tanugi]], and my personal vision is to massively improve humankind's ability to live sustainably and responsibly on Earth.

# Mission
I aim to accomplish this vision by deploying one or more innovations that leverage MIT research and that will have a strong positive impact on the availability of clean energy. In doing so, I advance Proto Ventures’ vision of using knowledge and MIT’s exceptional people to solve the world’s great challenges in fusion and clean energy.

My role as a Venture Builder focuses on clean energy, with an emphasis on technologies from the [[MIT Plasma Science & Fusion Center]] but also spanning many other areas of [[MIT]].
